It’s time to cast those thoughts aside because the standard penny loafer you wore in elementary school has endured a total makeover. These days, chunky loafers are the unofficial supermodel off-duty look — just ask <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kendall Jenner</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Hailey Bieber</a>. Plus, the loafer resurgence brought with it a truly massive variety of styles and design details, like thick, exaggerated straps, spunky metal hardware, trendy cutouts, and just about every finish you could want. But the best news? There's really no wrong way to do it. The only true tragedy here would be to only choose one style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-vagabond-20-platform-tassel-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vagabond 2.0 Platform Tassel Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vagabond 2.0 Platform Tassel Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2DN6fsDBo2-nnLCgZ9vpkVBfLQc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Vagabond-2.0-Platform-Tassel-Loafer-424375c5e39e4fad936f94390268f8e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These celebrity-loved shoes are both extremely durable and comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They aren’t offered in half-size options.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We often turn to celebrities to find the latest and greatest brands, and when it comes to shoes, they all seem to be a magnet for this Vagabond style. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emma Chamberlain</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Naomi Watts</a> are just a few who have been spotted traipsing around in the label’s creations. To finally see what the hype was about, InStyle commerce writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Tamim Alnuweiri</a> tested the 2.0 Platform Tassel Loafer, a style that Jenner has been wearing non-stop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a self-proclaimed Dr. Martens loyalist, Alnuweiri didn’t think this pair could compare to her chunky-soled favorite. But after taking the time to break these leather babies in, they’ve become her most worn — and new favorite — pair of shoes. When it comes to style, she finds that the shiny black leather goes with almost everything in her wardrobe and the thick 1.75-inch lug-sole makes them look cool and definitely less matronly than traditional loafers. Plus, the tassel adornment is fun.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The shoes really shine when it comes to functionality and durability. Alnuweiri appreciates how they support her heavy gait and that they feel much lighter than they look. Over several months they have maintained their shape and kept her feet feeling comfortable, even after 16-hour days. However, the crowning detail may be the fact that they can withstand the wear and tear of the New York City streets, which are known to devour even the toughest soles in record time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one thing that would make these shoes better is the sizing: They’re currently offered in whole sizes, so it makes finding the perfect fit a bit of a trial and error process.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6–11<strong> | Materials: </strong>Leather upper, rubber sole<strong> | Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Heel: </strong>1.75 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-crown-vintage-sage-penny-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Crown Vintage Penny Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Crown Vintage Sage Penny Loafer " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/V9DivLwXlViACqCXwZt5evCChcs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/CrownVintageSagePennyLoafer-1206f494a25b4285aecc903eaa4436b5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>DSW</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite the chunky heel, these shoes don’t feel weighty.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They are a bit big, so you’ll need to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many high-quality loafers clock in at well over $200, the Crown Vintage Sage Penny Loafer will cost you less than $100 (and they don’t skimp on construction or style). With a traditional penny loafer design on top of a 2.5-inch heel, we consider these to be an edgy remix of the timeless preppy style.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle’s former commerce editor, Mary Honkus, counts herself as one of the loafer’s biggest fans. “Despite being, well, chunky, these are surprisingly lightweight and painless to wear,” she shares. “I love that the block heel adds a bit of height without making me feel like I’m towering over everyone, and the padded footbed keeps my feet comfortable as I run around New York City.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Swapping true leather for a synthetic option — a detail which not only slashes the price, but also makes them a cinch to care for, a crucial detail if you opt for the lighter toned option. To boot, Honkus adds that the shoes have held up extremely well over the course of a year. “They're also super easy to style,” she says. “I've really been leaning into the trendy Gossip Girl school girl look and have paired them with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>plaid skirt</a>, cashmere sweater, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>blazer</a>. But really, the styling options are endless.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6–11<strong> | Materials: </strong>Synthetic leather upper, rubber sole<strong> | Colors: </strong>4<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heel: </strong>2.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-designer-gucci-womens-leather-lug-sole-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Designer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gucci Women’s Leather Lug-Sole Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gucci Women&amp;rsquo;s Leather Lug-Sole Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6vQ52edlX3EnypsbZb-3kDEkuDg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Gucci-Womens-Leather-Lug-Sole-Loafer-c68e742c441a4d4aa9d34fd711c6b149.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gucci</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>If you’re going to invest in a designer loafer, make it this iconic pair with the flashy, instantly recognizable horsebit hardware.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The shoes run slightly small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We don’t take our investment purchases lightly; they must be worth every penny to be considered.

This seemingly minor detail revamps the entire silhouette for an easy, slip-on style that adds an edge to any outfit. A gold toned embroidered bee on the heel is a glamorous, yet subtle, update and we just can’t get enough of Gucci’s celebrated horsebit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unsurprisingly, these were built to last.

But that doesn’t mean we don’t also adore the latest iterations with punchy details, which is why this pair from Sam Edelman has our hearts — it offers a bit of both, as it offers the structure of a traditional loafer, but with contrasting stitching and golden hardware.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re happy to report that the loafers offer much more than just looks. InStyle writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Irene Richardson</a> says these are one of her finest adult purchases. “When I went searching down the online loafer rabbit hole, I sought something affordable and versatile, and it needed to&nbsp; transition seamlessly between seasons. I’m happy to report this pair checks all those boxes,” she says. “They go with everything in my closet, but I’m mostly in love with how their chunky platform provides a bit of heft that deviates from preppy styles.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you walk to work, Richardson says these have got you covered once they’re broken in (which does take a few wears). “They’ve turned out to be quite the commuter shoe,” she says. The shoes don’t squish my feet even after trekking through a few thousand subway stops, and they're easy to clean.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–14<strong> | Materials: </strong>Leather,<strong> </strong>synthetic leather, fabric<strong> | Colors: </strong>6<strong> </strong>|<strong> Heel: </strong>1.75 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-reformation-agathea-chunky-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Agathea Chunky Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rdsDsO2E80L6E4q0ngOSpBYcqJ0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Agathea-Chunky-Loafer-3fe83cc9735542a2990717c9d0c0f0da.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Along with a conventional black hue, Reformation makes these loafers in a variety of spunky colors and patterns.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The style runs large.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Reformation may be best known for their celebrity-loved breezy dresses</a>, but their shoes shouldn’t be slept on, especially the Agathea Chunky Loafer. While the brand offers them in standard black, it’s the sleek, fun-loving patterns that make them extra special. What’s more, true to the brand's sustainable ethos, the loafers are constructed from recouro-regenerated leather — a mix of natural leather fibers, natural latex, and plant materials.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, associate fashion commerce editor, Ruby McAuliffe, applauded the surprising versatility of these edgy shoes after seeing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gigi Hadid</a> sporting them all summer. Comfort is also something you needn’t worry about with this pair because the platform isn’t all that high at 1.4 inches. Plus, the interior cushy padding is the sustainable iteration of EVA foam, meaning your feet won’t be aching after a full day’s wear. For the best fit, opt for a half-size down, as they can be a bit spacious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–11<strong> | Materials: </strong>Leather welt, rubber, recycled tire rubber chips, sustainable EVA foam, printed hair on cowhide<strong> | Colors: </strong>8 |<strong> Heel: </strong>1.4 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sustainable-franco-sarto-balinna-tassel-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sustainable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Franco Sarto Balinna Tassel Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Franco Sarto Balinna Tassel Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/a1tcbUUBgoLQIR9sE3JLBVePyaE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Franco-Sarto-Balinna-Tassel-Loafer-6919d217452f456688968b2ae1ef6466.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Franco Sarto</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The tassel adds a bit of playful flair.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There aren’t options for wide feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Known for their craftsmanship and great price tags, Franco Sarto prides themselves on creating elevated classics. In our eyes, the Ballina Tassel Loafer is the star of the loafer show. Available in two unique colorways, slate gray patent leather as well as biscuit brown with a cream upper, along with black, atop a chunky platform and heavily lugged sole, these loafers are a standout.

One downside is that they do require some break in time before they’re fully comfortable to wear — but once broken in, it feels like you’re walking on clouds. We recommend wearing them with a thick sock for short intervals to make the break in process a bit easier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–11<strong> | Materials: </strong>Leather, fabric, synthetic leather<strong> | Colors: </strong>3 |<strong> Heel: </strong>1.75 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-chunky-heel-reformation-lolita-platform-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Chunky Heel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Lolita Platform Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Lolita Platform Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/knyo6S2GWYzbokZXJt2UVZ6heoI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Lolita-Platform-Loafer-90c47028f3cc4b6ea62c701520bc9f65.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Although the heel is pretty high, the robust platform levels out your feet to make walking much more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>These can trigger gnarly blisters until they’re properly worn in.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We know what you’re thinking — there’s no way a shoe with such a high heel (4.3 inches to be exact) could possibly be pleasant to wear. Well, being the forward-thinking brand we know and love, Reformation already thought about that and found a solution to a potentially painful problem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The secret lies in the heightened design: The two-inch platform elevates the balls of your feet so you aren’t standing at such a harsh angle. That, paired with the broad square toe and pillowy soles, make them much more enjoyable to walk in. Keep in mind that the box calf leather upper can feel a bit rigid at first (and may cause friction), but the leather will soften with wear — patience is a virtue here.

So, when she decided to dive head first into the chunky loafer trend, ordering from the brand was a no-brainer — and they arrived in two days, to boot. “I love the sleek and shiny finish, and the sturdy body of the shoe,” she says.

As with many loafers, wearing socks will help break them in. That’s especially the case with this pair as the jagged upper outline can rub against the top of your feet.

On top of ensuring you select the right size (especially if you’re an online shopper), you need to search for designs that aren’t too confined or better yet, flexible — two features that are rather uncommon for loafers. However, Madewell’s Bradley Lug-Sole Loafers are the solution to your cramped-shoe woes. There's ample room in the toe box to comfortably fit wider feet, and with such an abundance of half-size options, you’re sure to find the perfect fit. They do tend to run about a half-size too big, so to be on the safe side, it may be best to choose a half-size down.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looks wise, they’re thick enough to be on trend, but these are remarkably lightweight, as if there was no chunky sole at all.

Plus, they’re long-lasting: Aside from the Nappa luxe leather (a softer leather that morphs to your feet quicker than other types), these shoes are also weather-repellent, so they’ll withstand rain, mud, and slush.

The penny loafer style includes traditional elements, including hand-sewn beef roll stitching, which gives the aesthetic slightly more heft, constructed with genuine leather, making it look just as cool with tailored high-waisted chinos as it does with cargo pants. We love to lean into the amazingly preppy vibe and styling them with white, delicate-looking, fold-down socks and a tennis skirt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in three colors — standard black, wine, and trendy, color-blocked black and white — this loafer retains its clean aesthetic, but the thick, toothy sole is a thoroughly modern detail.

Swap your sandals for these mules, which are an especially terrific choice to wear between seasons, and pair them with study denim or layered dresses for a moody vibe.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–12<strong> | Materials: </strong>Leather, synthetic leather<strong> | Colors: </strong>3 |<strong> Heel: </strong>1.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-penny-loafer-free-people-lyra-lug-sole-loafers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Penny Loafer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People Lyra Lug-Sole Loafers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People Lyra Lug-Sole Loafers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GU0p_AJ3Ed8BihrqO4Aps_cAwgI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Free-People-Lyra-Lug-Sole-Loafer-9f5ac153303b4cd596422bf5dd71075e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The traditional penny loafer design gets a major upgrade with the fun color selections.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Like many loafers, they run large.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A trusty chunky penny loafer is a true closet staple. It's a trusty loafer style that can be worn through all seasons and complete just about any outfit. Sure, there may be endless penny loafers to choose from, but this pair from Free People stands out from the rest —&nbsp;and not just because of the color variety, which we must say, is excellent. The true value all comes down to the high quality design of the shoe. They’re made with smooth, buttery leather that quickly morphs to the shape of your foot, and just-chunky-enough lug rubber platforms with thick, dramatic teeth on the sole.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike most of the other options on this list, this traditional penny loafer is available in several spunky colors, like bright turquoise, a more subdued olive, purple-tinged mulberry, and a mauve-blush pink hybrid. So if you’re looking to turn a classic on its head, this is one way to do it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one downside is they run a little big (which you’ve probably realized by now is relatively common for this shoe style). Try going down a half-size for the ideal fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>36–41<strong> | Materials: </strong>Leather, rubber<strong> | Colors: </strong>7 |<strong> Heel: </strong>1.75 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Uppers on chunky loafers are commonly made from three different materials: Leather, suede, or synthetic fibers. When it comes to durability, comfort, and lasting appeal, all of our experts endorse purchasing leather loafers. “Real leather forms to the foot over time, making them more comfortable,” explains New York City-based personal stylist Nejla Renee.&nbsp;(Think about your best pair of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leather sneakers</a> or boots, for example.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to leather, suede will also mold to your feet and is relatively dependable. That said, it requires more frequent upkeep and consistent cleaning to maintain, as it’s basically a magnet for picking up both city grime and country dirt. However, with regular brushing and spot treatments with white vinegar when needed, your suede will look fresh. If you fall in love with a stylish pair of suede loafers that are truly excellent for transitioning into fall, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bernardo Selma Suede Lug Loafer</a>, the additional care is well worth the effort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for synthetic leather, our experts say that aside from being water-resistant, they don’t compare in quality to real leather, and typically, they’re not as comfortable. “Sometimes people opt for synthetic leather thinking it’s more eco-friendly since no animals are harmed in production,” says Renee. “Do your research because a lot of synthetic leather options are made from plastic which end up being worse in the long run.” Still, if you’re on a budget and can’t afford real leather, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Crown Vintage Sage Penny Loafer</a> is an exceptional choice that has a minimal break in time.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Color</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Black and brown may be the most popular loafer colors, but some brands offer vibrant shades and patterned iterations. Take the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Reformation Agathea Chunky Loafer</a>, for example. The leopard pattern really makes a statement, especially with the upper made of silky printed hair on cowhide, but we’re also swooning over the other variations too, like the patent tortoise, as well as the color-blocked options in nutmeg and white and the more alternative-looking black and white.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the color you select really comes down to personal preference. If you’re looking for a versatile shoe, stick with a muted hue, like black or brown. “Black goes with everything, while brown can be a nice touch and easily transitions with different looks,” says New York-based image and wardrobe consultant Beverly Osemwenkhae, while Renee adds that metallics (including silver and gold) fall into the neutral category.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the flip side, professional wardrobe stylist Nicole Muteku suggests going bold with your shoes to “add personality to your look.” For a surprising pop of color, try the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Free People Lyra Lug-Sole Loafer</a> in serpent green or bright turquoise.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Heel</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While all chunky loafers inherently boost height with their thick soles, some have chunky heels to lengthen your legs. According to Osemwenkhae, loafer heels are usually around 1.5 to two inches. That’s not to say they can’t go higher: The heel on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Reformation Lolita Platform Loafer</a> is 4.3 inches tall (although it doesn’t feel it).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When selecting a heel height, consider how much you’ll be walking around in the shoes. The higher the heel, the more risk you take for aching arches. That is, unless you opt for a taller platform to keep your foot balanced at a comfortable angle.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questioned-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questioned, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I style chunky loafers?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of your personal style — preppy, goth, edgy, trendy, you name it — chunky loafers can go with pretty much any look. “There are so many ways to play,” says Osemwenkhae. “I love chunky loafers with a slip dress or a micro skirt and oversized sweater, and they also pair well with a relaxed suit.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To lean into the preppy trend, Muteku recommends pairing loafers with a chic sock for a fun flare. And if you want to keep things casual, Renee suggests styling the shoes with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>straight-leg jeans</a> and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>white T-shirt</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For busier styles, like leopard or color-blocked options, all our experts say to keep the rest of your outfit simple (try a solid colored dress or jeans and a button down) and really let the shoes take center stage. Osemwenkhae also says a monochrome look will highlight an attention-grabbing loafer.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you clean chunky loafers?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This depends on the material, but for the most part, you can wipe down leather shoes with a damp cloth to buff out scuffs and remove dirt. If your loafers have seen better days and need some extra TLC, take them to a leather repair shop. These experts have tools that will restore the shoes to their glory days.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For suede, we suggest investing in a suede brush to regularly wipe away dirt and grime.
