At the end of the episode, the cast secretly vote between the two lowest-ranked contestants to be the week’s guesser. The guesser then chooses any non-immune contestant and announces which celebrity they think that contestant is related to. If the guesser is correct, the other contestant is eliminated. If the guesser is incorrect, the guesser is eliminated. Contestants are eliminated one by one each week until one contestant remains, who is declared the winner and receives $100,000.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some people do feel like they’re obscured by somebody who they are connected to that’s more accomplished than they are, and other people find a way to use that to their advantage — and for other people, it’s irrelevant,” creator Chris Coelen told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> of Claim to Fame’s success in 2022. “That is one of the things that’s really fun about the show, is it does reflect back to us what’s going on in our culture.”</p><p>The Claim to Fame Season 1 winner was Loreal Chanel “LC” Palmer, the older sister of actor and singer Keke Palmer. “It’s a game, but real people are involved and real feelings,” LC told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 after her Claim to Fame Season 1 win. “I used to watch reality TV and when I’d see someone have a breakdown, I’d be like, ‘Oh this is so dramatic.’ But now I apologize to those people who I thought that about. I was not expecting the emotional toll that it took.”</p><p>She also revealed what Keke’s reaction to her win was. “I wish I would’ve filmed her reactions to some of the stuff because she is so serious and she’s always like, ‘Don’t tell me, I wanna watch and I wanna find out.’ It’s almost as entertaining as just watching [the show],'” she said.</p><p>But back to Claim to Fame Season 2’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>spoilers</a> and celebrity relatives.

Got it. Got it.’”</p><p>When asked if she thinks Tom will watch Claim to Fame Season 2, Carly told Entertainment Weekly, “I hope so. I mean, maybe I don’t want him to watch it because I don’t want to embarrass him for any reason. I hope I don’t embarrass him, but I don’t think I do,” she said. “So, I would love for him to watch it, because I think it’s hilarious… He’s happy for me no matter what. He did ask me, ‘Did you make some money?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, I made a little bit.’ And he said, ‘OK, good.’ So, he was happy that I made a little money.”</p><p><br>Claim to Fame Season 2 airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC and is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
