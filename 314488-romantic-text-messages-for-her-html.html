Yet, my love always finds you.</li><li>There is nothing that makes me happier than when I am with you.</li><li>To you, I may be one person, but to me, you are the world.</li><li>Together is where we belong, and I cannot imagine it any other way.</li><li>When I say I love you, I only want you to have my kids and never stop loving me.</li><li>You are my flower, the one that never withers.

Still, crafting the perfect love text can be quite daunting, especially if you do not have a way with words. Here are some romantic<a href=#> text messages</a> that will make her want you badly.</p><ul><li>Darling, you are the first person that comes to my mind every morning when I wake up and the last person on my mind when I go to sleep. You are the only person I would always want to see.</li><li>Falling for you has never been risky. You are worth every risk because I feel butterflies when I think of you. Whenever I prayed, I asked for one thing. I asked for a definition of love, and you came into my life.</li><li>For billions in gold or riches untold, I cannot exchange the feeling of love I have for you for a single day. I love you so much.</li><li>I cherish every moment with you because you give me more reasons to love you every day.</li><li>I dreamt I was the sun that came to your window and woke you up. Because I love you, I became the air that went through your lungs, and because of how I feel about you, I became the rhythm to which your heart kept beating.</li><li>I feel like writing a book made of all the memories I have of you and our time together. Those moments make me want to make more and still forget none.</li><li>I have never found the right words to tell or describe how I feel about you. I love you.</li><li>I hope you know that my love for you grows with each breath in the depth of my heart. I love you always.</li><li>I used to go to sleep every night, wishing to find true love. Every day I'd get more and more disappointed until I finally met you. Then all that waiting made sense, and my life gained a new meaning.</li><li>If I were an artist, your pictures would occupy every canvas, for you are always on my mind.</li><li>If I am to leave a mark in this world, I would need a star, moon and the sun, and you're all of it.</li><li>My greatest goal in life would be to love you and make you feel special. I would want to make you feel like you are the most beautiful woman in the whole world.</li><li>Roses are red that much is true; Violets, however, aren't really blue; Anyway, that's not really the point I wanted to make to you; Because the only thing that I really wanted to say was: I love you.</li><li>The most romantic thing in life is seeing your eyes find sleep and my body hugging you every morning. I need you more in my life.</li><li>The night sky is magical, but its magic will never be as serene as the moments I share with you.</li><li>There is no story better than how love found us both. I can tell it over and over again. I love you in ways I cannot explain.</li><li>They say true love does not exist; I would like to prove them wrong. You are a true testimony of true love. I love you dearly.</li><li>Thinking about you while lying in bed makes it harder to sleep but also much more bearable because of how happy you make me feel.</li><li>Trust me; there are not enough gifts to tell of your beauty because even word is not enough to tell of you.</li><li>When we are together, all the bad things in life fade away, and nothing else matters except for us being happy with each other.</li><li>You are brilliantly beautiful, and nothing can define you. Your eyes are a sparkle I always want to remember.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/99314d4d45927560.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Juicy hot seat questions for friends to get to know them better</span></p></a><h3 id=314488-charming-text-messages-for-her class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Charming text messages for her</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b88905e03de26a97.jpeg><p class=align-left>Are you looking for the perfect <a href=#>cute text messages</a> to make her want you?

I love you to the moon and back.</li><li>Someday, I hope to hold your wrinkled hand, look into your eyes, and say, "we did it."</li><li>Suppose I was to give you a gift that appreciates my deep love for you. I would give my heart to you again.</li><li>When life gets hard for me, I remember that I have you in my life, and I automatically feel better.</li><li>When my heart finds sleep, you become a sweet rhythm of the night.</li><li>You are indeed the light of my life, and when I get stuck in the darkness, you always bring me back.</li><li>You are my princess. You rule my world like the sun rules the day.</li><li>You glow like the star; sometimes, I feel you were plucked out of heaven to bring light to my life.</li><li>Your happiness is a seed in my heart.
