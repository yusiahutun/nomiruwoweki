So, who are these black people with blonde hair? What is their history?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/82240cc7a7738bd0.jpg><p class=align-left>Blonde hair is typically linked with Caucasian individuals. There are, however, certain populations of people with dark complexion and blonde hair known as Melanesians. Due to their blonde hair, the&nbsp;Melanesian people have become a scientific phenomenon over the past few years.</p><h2>Black people with blonde hair</h2><p class=align-left>What black African tribe has blonde hair? The Melanesians are the black <a href=#>African tribe</a> with blonde hair. Melanesian people live in the South Pacific, primarily in the islands of:</p><ul><li>Fiji</li><li>Papua New Guinea</li><li>Vanuatu</li><li>Solomon Islands</li><li>New Caledonia</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6604af2949f0e581.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>13 famous celebrities with strawberry legs who look great</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Melanesians, Micronesians, and Polynesians are one-third of the major Pacific Islander groups. Some of the features that make them stand out from the rest include:</p><ul><li>Dark skin</li><li>Broad noses</li><li>Blonde hair</li></ul><h2>Where did the Melanesians originate from?</h2><p class=align-left>These dark-skinned people with<a href=#> blonde hair</a> and blue eyes originated from Africa. They migrated to the South Pacific more than 50,000 years ago. They relocated long before the European explorers arrived in the Pacific during the 16th century.</p><p class=align-left>Black people with blonde hair are believed to be the descendants of the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> first Homosapiens</a>. A study on the individuals revealed that the Melanesian population was linked to the first group of Homosapiens, which emigrated from Africa more than two thousand generations ago.</p><p class=align-left>Researchers analysed the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA of Aboriginal Australians and Melanesians from New Guinea. Later, they compared the results with multiple DNA patterns related to early humans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79f65861462fb622.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ugliest animal in the world: 20 species and where to find them</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The findings proved that the Melanesians and Aborigines bear the same genetic features connected to the migration of humans from Africa&nbsp;over 50,000 years ago. Also, rather than interbreeding with them, the settlers replaced other early human beings, such as the Neanderthals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6604af2949f0e581.jpg><h2>What causes blonde hair in Melanesians?</h2><p class=align-left>Melanesian blonde hair and blue eyes result from isolation from other populations, leading to interbreeding within their community. While black people naturally have dark hair, Melanesians have a range of hair colours, including:</p><ul><li>Brown</li><li>Red</li><li>Blonde</li></ul><p class=align-left>Black people with blonde hair have fascinated many while prompting others to research more about them. From their extensive research, scientists found out that the gene responsible for blonde hair in Melanesians is different from the gene responsible for blonde hair in Europeans.</p><p class=align-left>For the Melanesians, the blonde gene on their hair results from a genetic mutation several thousands of years ago. The mutation has no connection to the same gene, causing blondeness among Europeans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4669434f4aab830d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ugly monkeys: 6 species that look scary (with pictures)</span></p></a><h2>What is the culture and traditions of Melanesians?</h2><p class=align-left>Black tribe with blue eyes and blonde hair has a rich culture with diverse and unique traditions passed down from generation to generation. There are extreme differences between rural and urban Melanesians, which include:</p><h3>Interpersonal relations</h3><p class=align-left>Males from the highlands of Papua New Guinea greeted each other by rubbing each other's groin region. However, the <a href=#>Western</a> handshake has replaced this traditional greeting among many people.</p><p class=align-left>Also, most groups required the occurrence of marriage after a special courtship between men and women. After wooing the females, marriages are negotiated between families, and they involve a <a href=#>bride price</a> paid by the son-in-law to the bride's father.</p><h3>Religion</h3><p class=align-left>Due to the active missionaries in Melanesia, Christianity has widely spread throughout. The missionaries are actively learning the Melanesianâ€™s native languages and translating the <a href=#>Bible</a> into those languages.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a8e86431881143c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Are skinwalkers real? All about the translucent humanoid creature</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Some native religions are still being practised, although in more modified forms. In the past, their original belief systems incorporated various aspects, such as cannibalism and headhunting. However, since the late 1920s, the two practices have been considered illegal.</p><h3>Language</h3><p class=align-left>Melanesia is a linguistic frontier since there is more than one official national language in most islands where Melanesians live. For example, people from Papua New Guinea have three official languages: English, Tok Pisin, and Hiri Motu.</p><p class=align-left>New Guinea Island has more than <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">1,000 different languages</a>. Despite having such a large number of languages, some have as few as 50 speakers, while others have as many as a few hundred thousand. However, most of the languages have never been documented.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79f65861462fb622.jpg><h3>Family life</h3><p class=align-left>Melanesians experience a great deal of antagonism between males and females, resulting in having men's and women's houses in most villages. For instance, among the Sepik River people, men have ceremonial houses that are off-limit to all women and other uninitiated men.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e439cfd561b71125.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 naturally blonde male celebrities that you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, women also play an important role in the Melanesian <a href=#>family</a> lives. For instance, women are considered the primary food producers and caretakers of children. They also play a significant role in political and ceremonial aspects of the society.</p><h3>Living conditions and social problems</h3><p class=align-left>Since Melanesians live in a tropical region, they experience various <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">environmental challenges </a>such as heat, rain, and mosquitoes. Healing takes a long time, so infection becomes a serious problem. However, the region is relatively healthy.</p><p class=align-left>Melanesians have been dealing with various modern-world challenges, such as alcoholism. With easy access to money, some Melanesian males have indulged in alcohol. Also, due to the lack of condoms until recently, HIV/AIDS has been a serious threat among the Papua New Guinea people.</p><h3>Gender issues</h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>relationships</a> between men and women vary significantly within the Melanesian culture. Even though male initiation is dominant, female initiation is also found in several societies.&nbsp;For instance, male and female initiation is practised among the Abelam of Papua New Guinea.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aa61bf1528c940ba.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 famous bald black actors that you should watch in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Segregation of the sexes has remained one of the most common gender issues in Melanesia. Previously, it was alleged that women, and by extension, children, were seen as polluting to men. However, recent discoveries have indicated that males are considered equally polluting to women.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the other aspects that define Melanesian culture and traditions include:</p><ul><li>Location and homeland</li><li>Folklore</li><li>Major holidays</li><li>Rites of passage</li><li>Clothing</li><li>Food and drinks</li><li>Education systems</li><li>Work</li><li>Sports</li><li>Entertainment and recreation</li><li>Folk art, crafts, and hobbies</li></ul><h2>Can African-Americans have blonde hair?</h2><p class=align-left>African Americans can have natural blonde hair. Even though the phenomenon of black people with blue eyes and blonde hair is rare, some people have it since no one race or demographic does not own blonde hair.</p><p class=align-left>Afro-Americans with blonde hair are a testament to how diverse and broad the African diaspora can get. In addition, similar to African skin tones, they have a wide range of hair colours and textures.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/00d7c9a64d010a0a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The story of Chang and Eng Bunker: Wives, children, death</span></p></a><h2>Black people with blonde hair - Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>Black people with blonde hair have defied all stereotypes against black people who have blonde hair.
