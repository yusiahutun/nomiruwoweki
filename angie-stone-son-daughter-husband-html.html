Angie had a daughter Diamond from her husband in 1984. However, the couple's marriage did not last long as the husband-wife duo separated in the 90s. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>And it was the ten&nbsp;times Grammy-nominated&nbsp;singer's affair with&nbsp;neo-soul&nbsp;singer&nbsp;D'Angelo which heated the media in the mid-90s. Regarded as one of the most promising singers at the time, D'Angelo's romance with someone 13 years his senior made the couple media darlings, the 90s answer to Beyonce and Jay Z.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The couple was together way before D'Angelo even got his name on the radar of the media. Back then, he was just 19, and Angie remained his stone and also braided his short hair for his first album. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>It turns out the couple even shared a son, Michael D'Angelo, who was born on 28th&nbsp;February 1997, from their 4-year relationship.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Angie Stone with D'Angelo and son Michael</strong>&nbsp;<strong>back in the 2000s</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: iloveoldschoolmusic.com) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>However, in 1999 the Celebrity&nbsp;Fit Club Star was diagnosed with type II diabetes and struggled to manage her weight leading to her divorce with D'Angelo.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>After a void of relationships in the No More Rain singer's life, she again found love in early 2009. She confirmed about&nbsp;dating an airport worker Ashanti, and the couple was engaged in December 2009. She called her fiance the right man for her and explained that he was god's gift to her, speaking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Essence</a> magazine in 2009. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>She said of her fiance:</p><p style=text-align:justify>"When we&nbsp;met, we just hugged each other and I knew this was the man I was going to spend the rest of my life with and vice versa.

The star reportedly punched her daughter Diamond with metal jewelry after having differences knocking out the front two teeth.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Police were called to the scene and resulted in her arrest on an assault charge.

On the very tweet, she thanked the fans for their continuous support through the tried times. Despite what had entailed between the two, the veteran singer asserted that she loved her daughter no matter what. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Listeners might know but Diamond - like her mother - possesses a passion for singing.
