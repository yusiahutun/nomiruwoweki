He was also ordered not to contact the singer directly or indirectly, or post about him on social media.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Tarazaga-Orero was given a 12-month community order and 30 days of rehabilitation. Dean said: “You should be aware that failing to comply with a community order is a criminal offence that carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Katy Weiss, prosecuting, said: “I spoke to Mr Styles yesterday and he’s adamant he wants [the defendant] to get help, although he doesn’t want to see him again.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The court heard Styles first came in contact with Tarazaga-Orero after noticing him sleeping rough close to his north <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>London</a> home, and offered him money to get food or a hotel. Styles told the court: “I thought it was sad that someone so young was sleeping rough at a bus stop when it was cold.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Tarazaga-Orero, a vegan, asked for edamame beans, the court heard. The following day, the singer returned with two sandwiches, two salads and two muffins from a vegan cafe but decided to stop interacting with the defendant because of his “odd” behaviour.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Styles told the court: “He asked me if I wanted to go to a restaurant to eat. I told him I was on my way to work. I found it a little odd. His facial expression made me feel a little uneasy. It was like a smirk. Until that point, I never felt unsafe or uneasy in my own home.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Despite severing contact with the man on the advice of his security staff, Styles continued to see Tarazaga-Orero “incredibly often … almost every day”. In April, Tarazaga-Orero posted coins to the value of £49.95 through the singer’s letterbox.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Styles said he was also followed into a local pub a number of times and stopped on a run on 30 May by Tarazaga-Orero, who asked for money.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The defendant claimed he chose to sleep in Styles’s neighbourhood after he became homeless in February because it felt safer than central London. He said he could make up to £100 from the public each day, adding: “I was surprised, and many people helped me.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>When asked whether he had stalked the celebrity, Tarazaga-Orero said: “That was never my intention. In the end, I just wanted the money he offered me.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>He denied being obsessed or in love with Styles.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The defendant suggested the pop star propositioned him, telling the court he had said: “‘Let’s come to a hotel, let’s have some fun’, or something like that.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The court heard Tarazaga-Orero’s stalking continued to have a “significant impact” on Styles’s day-to-day life.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The singer said: “I never really encountered this kind of behaviour before. I’ve employed a night guard. I continue to lock my bedroom door at night.” He added that he continued to check for weak spots in his home.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Tarazaga-Orero carried a copy of the Gita, a Hindi holy book adopted by the Hare Krishna movement, and wore a necklace of paper flowers in the dock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKWlqLake5FpaHJnn5jBcH6QaJ%2BaqqKuerTA2KWcrGWjqa6tt8SrZKimlWKxqr7EnKuip55iwKq6xp6p</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fharry-styles-stalker-one-direction-singer.html&text=Harry%20Styles%20stalker%20told%20to%20keep%20away%20from%20ex-One%20Direction%20singer%20%7c%20Harry%20Styles&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fharry-styles-stalker-one-direction-singer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fharry-styles-stalker-one-direction-singer.html&title=Harry%20Styles%20stalker%20told%20to%20keep%20away%20from%20ex-One%20Direction%20singer%20%7c%20Harry%20Styles" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fharry-styles-stalker-one-direction-singer.html&title=Harry%20Styles%20stalker%20told%20to%20keep%20away%20from%20ex-One%20Direction%20singer%20%7c%20Harry%20Styles" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fharry-styles-stalker-one-direction-singer.html&title=Harry%20Styles%20stalker%20told%20to%20keep%20away%20from%20ex-One%20Direction%20singer%20%7c%20Harry%20Styles" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fharry-styles-stalker-one-direction-singer.html&description=Harry%20Styles%20stalker%20told%20to%20keep%20away%20from%20ex-One%20Direction%20singer%20%7c%20Harry%20Styles" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ugandan-man-102-children-and-12-wives-says-enough-enough.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ugandan man with 102 children, 12 wives admits he has been irresponsible">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gal-gadot-shows-physique-in-sheer-dress-and-underwear.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gal Gadot shows off her action hero physique in a sheer dress and underwear">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
