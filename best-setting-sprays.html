Luckily, there's a foolproof way to keep your makeup from dripping off of your face, and it requires only one extra step at the end of your makeup routine. A quick spritz of a setting spray is all it takes to ensure your makeup stays put for hours on end — while feeling completely weightless on the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are so many formulas to consider, and not all are created equal. To help you find the perfect setting spray for your skin type, we enlisted the help of a handful of reviewers to research the most popular options and try them out firsthand in our lab. We spritzed our way through 28 setting sprays — keeping finish, formula and lasting power top of mind — to find the 11 best options. In the end, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Benefit Cosmetics Super Setter Pore-Minimizing Setting Spray</a> caught our attention because of its pore-blurring finish and long-lasting hold, even after being splashed with water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to find the full list of best makeup setting sprays, according to InStyle testers.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-benefit-cosmetics-the-porefessional-super-setter-pore-minimizing-setting-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Benefit Cosmetics The POREfessional Setting Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Benefit Cosmetics The POREfessional: Super Setter Pore-Minimizing Setting Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IJh0-003dYehH9SgQtmlyB36tpM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/benefit-cosmetics-the-porefessional-super-setter-pore-minimizing-setting-spray-02ae837067b7421aac1a5fe14bf3ba41.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Setting sprays are known to be multi-functional, but this one from Benefit Cosmetics truly does it all. Although the ultra-fine mist feels completely weightless on the face, it shrinks the look of pores, locks makeup in place, and keeps it looking fresh for up to 16 hours. Even after our reviewer put it through extensive waterproof testing, her makeup didn't budge. "It's comparable to a little rain jacket for my makeup," she says. "I was surprised to find that my makeup didn't run, smear, or move at all even after giving it a good splash."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the best things about this setting spray is that it blurs enlarged pores — but, in order to do that, it sits on top of the skin. If you, like our tester, are part of the camp of beauty lovers that prefers products that melt into the skin, take note that this one doesn't quite do that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4 fl. oz. |<strong> Scented: </strong>No | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-beauty-bakerie-spray-your-grace-setting-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Beauty Bakerie Spray Your Grace Setting Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Beauty Bakerie Spray Your Grace Baking Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ljQgcREgaxKHQGsNRC9OdatJC8I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beauty-bakerie-spray-your-grace-baking-spray-3195a897d7924140b5e9a28a44658f9f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When a brand has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Beyoncé's stamp of approval</a>, you know it's legit. Like all of Beauty Bakerie's creations, this product has adorable packaging, a sweet treat-inspired scent (vanilla, in this case), skin-loving ingredients, and incredible staying power.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Inside the pink and white spray bottle is a calming blend of aloe and ginger extracts that work to prep the skin for makeup and set everything in place. Although the lightweight mist contains hydrating ingredients, the setting spray doesn't leave skin feeling sticky or wet — rather, according to our tester, it settles into the skin on contact. Despite being splashed with water, she shares that her makeup didn't move or transfer, even when she blotted her face with a towel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fragrance, although addictive, is not for everyone. Our tester loved how subtle the scent was and noted that it didn't irritate her skin at all. However, those with sensitive skin might want to steer clear, especially if they have a tendency to react badly to fragrances.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>3.4 fl. oz. |<strong> Scented: </strong>Yes | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-pixi-beauty-makeup-fixing-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pixi Beauty Makeup Fixing Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pixi Beauty Makeup Fixing Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OAHE7RjtzIxozGItt6brqvym4bE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pixi-beauty-makeup-fixing-mist-68f716e391bf40089554f60c87ef281a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We're not the first to say it and we certainly won't be the last: You don't need to spend a ton of money to find beauty products that actually work. Case in point: Kim Kardashian once shared that she swears by Pixi Beauty's glycolic acid toner, proving that the London-based brand doesn't mess around when it comes to high-quality formulations. Unsurprisingly, the line's makeup-fixing mist is stellar — it prolongs makeup wear and keeps it from melting, even when temps reach triple digits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With ingredients like rose water, willow bark extract, and green tea, this hydrating and balancing pick is a great option for those with dry, flaky skin. "You can feel the refreshing ingredients settling into your skin right away," our tester shares. "It dried on contact and made my makeup look so smooth."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A few reviewers online felt that the spray gave off a strong rose smell. If you're easily bothered by fragrances, this one might not be for you. Rest assured, though, that our tester says the fragrance becomes less noticeable over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2.7 fl. oz. |<strong> Scented: </strong>Yes | <strong>Finish: </strong>Soft-focus</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-rare-beauty-always-an-optimist-4-in-1-prime--set-mist></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hydrating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rare Beauty Prime & Set Mist</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rare Beauty Always An Optimist 4-in-1 Prime &amp;amp; Set Mist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/I8As6k3YR4QPLth3KciSntk9AM4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rare-beauty-always-an-optimist-4-in-1-prime--set-mist-6fb2779ec91043eca0959b22dc1a02bc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This multitasking spray from Rare Beauty takes care of your skin during every phase of your glam, starting with prep and carrying you throughout the day. It's formulated with hydrating ingredients like niacinamide and sodium hyaluronate to lock in moisture and make the skin look brighter and more plump.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To ensure skin stays calm through all day wear, the formula features a soothing botanical blend of lotus, gardenia and white water lily. Aside from giving her skin a healthy-looking glow, our tester found that it helped lock her foundation onto her skin. "It gave my makeup a very natural, glowy finish," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of its damp texture, the tester says that her makeup transferred a little bit. "All in all, it was waterproof, but I noticed some of my makeup on the towel I used to blot my face during testing," she explains. "My foundation still looked untouched, though, which is all I care about."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 2.87 fl. oz. |<strong> Scented:</strong> Yes |<strong> Finish: </strong>Dewy</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-13 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4480 data-sizes=750px alt="A woman sprays Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez Always An Optimist 4-in-1 Prime & Set Mist on her face" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uIffgSVUj2ZD1Mw7aVEw3DU6AZQ=/fit-in/1500x4480/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/setting-spray-Rare-Beauty-by-Selena-Gomez-Always-An-Optimist-4-in-1-PrimeSet-Mist-tamara-staples-02-2fbf7649d3b7487096412d86bdcdda08.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4348 data-sizes=750px alt="A staged photo of Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez Always An Optimist 4-in-1 Prime & Set Mist bottles and a makeup brush" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hsc1Nh-rokCmoTp005empdmTTOs=/fit-in/1500x4348/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/INS-Rare-Beauty-by-Selena-Gomez-Always-An-Optimist-4-in-1-Prime_Set-Mist-tamara-staples-0036-35cd01c4de014c5c96266a86cc58fdd0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-water-resistant-urban-decay-all-nighter-waterproof-makeup-setting-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Water Resistant</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Urban Decay All Nighter Long Lasting Makeup Setting Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MP5re8_rvW65FlRIbbipFISjEwM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/urban-decay-all-nighter-long-lasting-makeup-setting-spray-4049e7e57a454325be278475676fdbdc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Often labeled the MVP of setting sprays, this Urban Decay option remains a favorite among makeup artists and beauty lovers alike for a number of reasons. First, it's water-resistant — meaning it stands up to unexpected rainstorms, midday sweat and even romcom-induced tears for up to 16 hours. Our tester shares that even after splashing water on her face, her makeup barely moved. Second, those with oily skin will appreciate that the lightweight formula is infused with kaolin clay to absorb excess oil and control shine throughout the day. Lastly, the setting spray imparts a satin finish on the skin that isn't too dewy or too matte, but rather falls somewhere in between.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The spray bottle's nozzle is powerful and each spritz is pretty potent, especially when used up close.

Made with hydrating botanical oils, the formula works as a primer that can be used before applying makeup or as a way to refresh your skin throughout the day. "The mist feels weightless on the skin and gives it a subtle glow," our tester shares. It even helps combat signs of aging with the help of amino acids and other ingredients to increase collagen production — which also makes skin look plumper and more radiant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It isn't lost on our tester that the price is pretty high, especially given the size of the product.

Ideal for big events, Lawless Beauty's lightweight mist keeps makeup looking freshly applied for hours on end — 16 to be exact. Unlike other sprays, it extends the life of your makeup without causing it to cake, crease, or settle into fine lines, which is great news for those with mature skin. The formula contains spherical elastomer powder, an ingredient known to absorb oil and reduce shine, as well as a blend of essential oils to refresh the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing we'd like to call out is that after reading reviews online, a few users noted that their spray bottles leaked product from the pump. "I love the smell, the black bottle and the packaging, but something about my pump doesn't work right," one user writes. "It eventually got stuck and stopped spraying properly." If this happens to you, we recommend transferring the liquid into a separate spray bottle and continuing use as normal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size</strong>: 1.7 fl oz | <strong>Scented</strong>: No | <strong>Finish</strong>: Natural</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-spf-milani-make-it-last-setting-spray-prime--correct--set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best With SPF</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Milani Make It Last Setting Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Milani style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xy_-kKCPNj9K4HDlFv5FMygCZN4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/milani-33ee8bbc283f4285a59f1b14ec90d9fe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No one wants their makeup to melt off their face, but protecting your skin against sun damage is equally as important as having flawless foundation.

Formulated with sensitive skin in mind, this cult-favorite spray contains hypochlorous acid, an ingredient naturally produced by the body to fight redness and irritation, along with a whole slew of other pH-balancing components. It's even received the National Eczema Association's Seal of Acceptance, so you know it's safe for all skin types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The spray can be used throughout the day to help minimize the look of flare-ups and stressed skin, as well as keep makeup looking and feeling fresh. I personally keep the spray on hand at all times, especially on hot, humid days when my acne-prone skin needs a quick zhuzh. Even after splashing her face with cold water, our tester reported that her makeup stayed intact and didn't smudge when drying her face off with a towel.

After honing in on online ratings, we spent 30 hours putting the 28 most popular setting sprays to the test. We had each of our testers try the setting sprays over makeup so they could analyze the performance of each one and write down their insights during the process. If any product claimed to be waterproof, the testers splashed water on their face, then dabbed with a towel to note makeup that ran or transferred. In doing so, our testers rated each setting spray from a scale of 1 to 5 for three key categories: comfort, performance, and water resistance. Once the data was collected, we were able to narrow down the original pool of products to the 11 best setting sprays.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to selecting the right formula, professional makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jonet Williamson</a> suggests starting with the ingredient list.

For some, it might be beneficial to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>prime the skin</a> with the same spray or finish up with a sweep of powder to ensure long-wearing results. "A trick that I like to do for my clients with oily skin is to spray a layer of setting spray before and after makeup," Williamson adds. "For makeup that holds up under masks, I'd suggest double setting, which means using a setting powder and spray."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you apply setting spray to other parts of the body?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's also important to note that setting spray isn't exclusively for your face makeup; it can also be applied to the eyes and lips. In addition to locking your glam in place, Williamson recommends using a setting spray to take your eyeshadow to new heights. "Setting sprays can also come in handy when doing your eye makeup," she says. "It can turn a matte shadow into a cream liner and intensify the color payoff of shimmery shadows." To put this tip into action: dip your brush into the powder first, then give a spritz of setting spray before tapping onto your lids or swiping across your lash line — you'll notice the impact immediately.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-instyle-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is InStyle Picks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you notice the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle Picks seal of approval</a> at the top of this story?
