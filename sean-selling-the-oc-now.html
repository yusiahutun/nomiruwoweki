He played a more background role in Seasons 1 and 2 before he found himself at the center of the drama in Season 3. But what happened to Sean from Selling The OC and where is he now that filming ended? Read on for where <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/selling-the-oc-cast-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean from Selling The OC is now</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-happened-with-sean-from-selling-the-oc>What happened with Sean from Selling The OC?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sean-Selling-The-OC.jpg><p>What happened with Sean from Selling The OC? Most of Sean Palmieri’s storyline on Selling The OC Season 3 revolved around his feuds with co-stars Tyler Stanaland and Austin Victoria. Much of Sean’s drama with Tyler and Austin came from his accusation that Austin and his wife, Lisa Victoria, asked him to have a threesome. “I do think that him and his wife are a bit too flirty for my taste sometimes,” Sean told other Oppenheim Group agents about a time he was at Austin and Lisa’s house. “They’re a little bit flirty. First off, this guy’s married. My headspace would never think to go there.”</p><p>Sean continued in a confessional interview, “I’m not here to judge underlying parts of someone’s relationship. You can be open, you can do whatever you want. I’m not here to judge. But he has been very interesting towards me in the past. He has made moves on me. If your wife is touching me, saying, ‘You’re my favourite in the office.’ That could lead to hints. I choose to stay away from these situations.”</p><p>Austin and Lisa, for their part, also discussed the hangout with Sean in their own scene, where they claimed that nothing inappropriate happened. “I don’t really talk to [Sean] anymore. I don’t know if it’s true… but remember that night when we invited Sean over? You made cookies that night. So he came over, we cooked him dinner, we played Oculus… and then he went home. Apparently his story is much different,” Austin said.</p><p>Austin continued, “His story is he came over, we ‘drugged him’ with marijuana cookies and tried to have a three-way with him. That pisses me off. My daughters are upstairs. That guy has some sick shit going on in his head to even come up with that scenario.” Lisa added, “We’ve never had a three-way, and it’s not going to be with you, Sean.”</p><p>Later in Selling The OC Season 3, Sean and Austin’s feud came to a head when Austin confronted Sean about his claim at The Oppnenheim Group office. “You told me when we were friends, you gave me all this stuff you and your wife were into. I don’t care if you’re doing foursomes, flipping… You made a move, and you’re made that I’m not into it,” Sean told Austin, who responded, “I’ve never had a threesome! You’re disgusting. You think everyone hits on you. I would never want to hit on you. You’re the last person I would ever hit on. My fucking kids were upstairs.” Sean replied, “You hit on me. You said, ‘If I wasn’t married, the things I would do… I said, ‘Austin, I’m not here for this.’ You told me you and your wife were experimenting, and you were open to certain things.”</p><p>In Selling The OC Season 3 finale, Sean confronts Austin again for denying the rumors at a horse race, where he gets into another fight with Austin, as well as Tyler, whom he claims also sent him inappropriate texts. The fight ended with Sean walking out while telling Tyler, “I didn’t want it to end like this, man.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-s-sean-from-selling-the-oc-now>Where’s Sean from Selling The OC now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sean-Selling-The-OC-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=so-where-s-sean-from-selling-the-oc-now>So where’s Sean from Selling The OC now?</h2><p>Where’s Sean from Selling The OC now? Sean announced in an interview with <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.etonline.com/selling-the-ocs-sean-palmieri-exits-the-oppenheim-group-exclusive-215132 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in November 2023 that he had left The Oppenheim Group. “Unfortunately, the Oppenheim Group was not a culture fit for me, and I’m really excited for the future,” he said, adding that had “just signed as a partner with an amazing, top-producing team and mentor” named Steve Games. “Our team recently just launched with Coldwell Banker West.”</p><p>He told the site that it brings him “great joy” to return to the real estate market in San Diego County, where he first landed after moving from Florida to California. “I’m eager to explore the opportunities that lie ahead for my business and success in this vibrant community,” he said.</p><p>Jason Oppnehim also confirmed Sean’s exit from The Oppenheim Group in an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/selling-the-ocs-sean-palmieri-left-oppenheim-group-after-toxic-time/>Us Weekly</a> in May 2023. “Sean is not at the Oppenheim Group anymore,” Jason said, confirming that Sean was not fired and that it was his own “decision” to leave the brokerage. As for why Sean left, Jason suspected that it had to do with his drama with Tyler Stanaland and Austin Victoria. “I can’t imagine that it didn’t have something to do with it, but I’m sure that professionally he wasn’t finding a lot of success,” Jason said. “And then I think maybe this added to the frustration, but I don’t know. It’s really a strong question.”</p><p>Austin, for his part, also accused Sean of making things “toxic in the office.” “It felt like when he was there I couldn’t be there. Some of us didn’t want to be there when he was there. If we had events or anything,” he said. “It was kind of like we’re trying to keep ourselves separate because I don’t want that in my life. I have enough going on. I’m a father, I’m a husband, and I am growing my business. That’s what my focus is on, and I don’t need to deal with lies and rumors.”</p><p>Austin also claimed that Sean told other co-workers that he was upset over the lack of camera time he got on the series compared to other agents. “He had mentioned to numerous people in the office that he didn’t get screen time, season one and season 2 ,” Austin said. “I know Sean was going through some stuff I know financially as well. So I was there for him, his friend, he opened up to me [on] numerous occasions and unfortunately, I became the target.”</p><p>Jason, for his part, also confirmed that he has no ill will toward Sean. “Generally, things work themselves out and I think people make the decisions that are best for them. I think that the fact that Sean came to me and told me that he was going to be leaving probably made things easier,” he said. “I think in my position, I really just want everyone to be doing what they think is best for them, both professionally and personally. I want everyone to succeed, whether it’s at the Oppenheim Group or outside the Oppenheim Group.”</p><p>According to his Instagram biography, Sean still lives in Los Angeles, California. As for where he stands with his cast mates, Sean is not followed by Polly Brindle, Kayla Cardona, Alex Hall, Tyler Stanaland, and Austin Victoria, nor does he follow them back. He is followed, however, by Gio Helou, Alexandra Jarvis, Brandi Marshall, and Alexandra Rose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/brett-oppenheim.jpg><p>Where’s Sean from Selling The OC Now?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpoaWdsgHiBj2iqnpmeYsCmuMuipaBlpJ2ybrvCZqWor18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsean-selling-the-oc-now.html&text=Where%27s%20Sean%20From%20Selling%20The%20OC%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Season%203%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsean-selling-the-oc-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsean-selling-the-oc-now.html&title=Where%27s%20Sean%20From%20Selling%20The%20OC%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Season%203%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsean-selling-the-oc-now.html&title=Where%27s%20Sean%20From%20Selling%20The%20OC%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Season%203%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsean-selling-the-oc-now.html&title=Where%27s%20Sean%20From%20Selling%20The%20OC%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Season%203%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsean-selling-the-oc-now.html&description=Where%27s%20Sean%20From%20Selling%20The%20OC%20Now%3f%20What%20Happened%20After%20Season%203%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./abhishek-malhan-opens-up-about-losing-bigg-boss-ott-2-to-elvish-yadav-im-winning-every-day-in-my-life-1296402.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Abhishek Malhan opens up about losing Bigg Boss OTT 2 to Elvish Yadav: 'I'm winning every day in my ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./new-york-city-private-schools.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New York City Private Schools Competition">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
