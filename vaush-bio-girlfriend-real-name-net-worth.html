Vaush is thought to have commented on Piker’s suspension during his live stream, but he was also banned for an indeterminate amount of time. Piker was suspended by Twitch for using the term “cracker.”</p><p>On 13 December 2021, Vaush took to his Twitter to claim that he had been suspended ‘indefinitely’ just after ending a live stream. He further updated on his YouTube where he wrote, “UPDATE: I was banned right after this stream ended lmao.”</p><p>The streamer uploaded a copy of a Twitch email that he said he received, which read: “Based on the review of your activity or content, we have issued a Community Guidelines strike on your account. Due to the severe nature of this violation, or the fact that you’ve incurred multiple violation(s), your access to Twitch services is indefinitely restricted.”</p><p>The streaming platform also gave him the reason for the suspension as “hateful slurs or symbols” Then Vaush tweeted again, “Indefinite, no less. Proud of Twitch for finally taking a stand against anti-white racism.”</p><h3><strong>Does Vaush Have A Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>Yes, according to some of his tweets and Instagram posts, Vaush does seem to have a girlfriend. He has shared a picture of his girlfriend once on his Instagram in December 2020.</p><p>Moreover, he has also tweeted about his girlfriend.

We’ll make it up in spades tomorrow.<strong>“</strong></p><p>Again in June 2019, he tweeted, “My girlfriend and I are both mentally ill, and Pastel was the one who made advances towards me I know you don’t care about facts, so enjoy the feeling of watching me grow utterly undeterred by your lying”</p><p>In November 2019, he tweeted again, “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">My girlfriend, @verminsqueals, who I love dearly, is streaming right now at </span><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir=ltr role=link href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-hiw28u r-qvk6io r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" aria-hidden=true>http://</span>vermin.gg/live</a><span>!
