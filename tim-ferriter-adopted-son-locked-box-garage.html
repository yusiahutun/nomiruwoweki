While he described the alleged mistreatment as "dehumanizing," he also said he believed his parents made a "mistake" and others should "forgive them and move on."</p><p>The box inside the garage of Ferriter's Florida home was discovered after the teen ran away in January 2022. Police had already been alerted about the room by contractors who built it; once authorities found the boy, he allegedly told cops it was where he was confined for anywhere up to 16-18 hours. A similar structure was allegedly built in the family's previous Arizona home as well; the boy allegedly had no other bedroom in either home.</p><p>In court on Wednesday, the Ferriters' son testified the windowless 8x8 room was built inside the garage. The structure had a twin mattress on a concrete floor, no windows and both an air conditioner and lights he couldn't control, he said. The boy claimed he was sometimes kept in total darkness, with locks on the outside preventing him from leaving on his own.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I had a bucket for urine and feces."<a href=#>#TimothyFerriter</a>'s adopted son takes the stand in the <a href=#>#BoyInTheBoxTrial</a>.<br>"RF" says his only option for a bathroom was to use a bucket in an 8x8 cell where Timothy allegedly locked him up.<a href=#>#CourtTV</a> What do YOU think?⚖️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/t4gSPQReDU</a></p>— Court TV (@CourtTV) <a href=#>October 4, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@CourtTV</a><p>"It had a bucket for my urine and feces and that was it," he added, saying the room would sometimes smell "putrid." He also claimed he "received water occasionally but not on a regular basis."</p><p>When asked by prosecutors how being in the room made him feel, he said, "To me, being locked in a room, it's dehumanizing. It's almost as bad as genocide. It's saddening, to abuse a child that was just acting like a child." He also said he would be "put into the room by physical force" if he resisted ... and claimed his father once "smacked" him in the face and would "spank" him with a jumprope or belt, while yelling.</p><p>During cross-examination by Tim Ferriter's defense team, he was asked whether it was hard for him to think of any "good memories" he had with his parents.</p><p>"I can easily recall the good times. I don't have a bad image of Tim and Tracy, they just made a mistake," he testified. "They were just acting out of frantic surprise of my actions. I believe they weren't trying to do any harm. I believe people should recognize that was a mistake, forgive them and move on."</p><p>When asked about his "actions," the boy admitted to doing some "not so legal stuff" at school, said he would throw and kick things when angry and intentionally broke the "rules" of the home at least five times a week. "Usually more," he said under oath.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WPBF</strong></a>, footage from a Ring camera positioned inside the structure showed Tim cursing at the boy and throwing things around the room. He also reportedly threatened to keep the boy in the box much more in the future if he continued to act out in school.</p><p>During opening statements, the defense <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>reportedly</strong></a> said the Ferriters' behavior was simply a case of "bad parenting," but didn't rise to the level of criminal. Tim Ferriter's lawyer said the room was used for "monitoring" the child.</p><p>"Bad parenting does not mean that a person should be charged with a crime," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>said defense attorney Prya Murad</strong></a>. "It makes them human. It makes them a parent who is trying to figure out when faced with a child who has consistent and escalating behavioral issues, how to handle them."</p><p>The two parents are being tried separately, with Tim's trial happening first; Tracy has been present in court, sitting behind him during his trial. The father previously rejected a plea deal.</p><p>The trial is ongoing.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:93358111-27db-4b91-8f82-dc9af459c332 data-container-ref=toofab:article:791d111c-d79d-4894-a028-2a5658bdaf52 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1a/5by4/2023/09/30/1ae394f1a47d4f67827e83cc863caa9f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">La Porte County Sheriff's Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mom Accused of Recruiting Kids to Help Move Husband’s Dismembered Body Sentenced</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmaW1fqbauecWeqauhpJq%2Fbq3DqKetnZRiwLC6jKWmnKOVmXqju9dmnpqqkZyycA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftim-ferriter-adopted-son-locked-box-garage.html&text=Teen%20Whose%20Parents%20Allegedly%20Made%20Him%20Live%20In%208x8%20Box%20Testifies%20About%20%27Dehumanizing%27%20Experience&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftim-ferriter-adopted-son-locked-box-garage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftim-ferriter-adopted-son-locked-box-garage.html&title=Teen%20Whose%20Parents%20Allegedly%20Made%20Him%20Live%20In%208x8%20Box%20Testifies%20About%20%27Dehumanizing%27%20Experience" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftim-ferriter-adopted-son-locked-box-garage.html&title=Teen%20Whose%20Parents%20Allegedly%20Made%20Him%20Live%20In%208x8%20Box%20Testifies%20About%20%27Dehumanizing%27%20Experience" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftim-ferriter-adopted-son-locked-box-garage.html&title=Teen%20Whose%20Parents%20Allegedly%20Made%20Him%20Live%20In%208x8%20Box%20Testifies%20About%20%27Dehumanizing%27%20Experience" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftim-ferriter-adopted-son-locked-box-garage.html&description=Teen%20Whose%20Parents%20Allegedly%20Made%20Him%20Live%20In%208x8%20Box%20Testifies%20About%20%27Dehumanizing%27%20Experience" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./self-tanner-mistakes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Youre Doing It Wrong: Self Tanner">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./futbol-internacional.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Premier League: El Bournemouth es equipo de Premier League">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
