With her sweet, dark, hypnotic tone, Walker invites fans into her world, showcasing how it feels when happily ever after never happens. Throughout the 20-track album, she opens herself up to the public, walking us through her heartbreak—from sadness to anger to relief in her newfound freedom. And in what might be the most vulnerable move of all, she allows the man who broke her heart his own place within the music: He’s the producer for half the songs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Using heart-wrenching and melodic lyrics, Walker stands out in the sea of “trap” R&B, a modern take on blues relying heavily on nostalgia, where male artists—like Drake or The Weeknd—have been at the forefront. Unlike her male competitors who boast about their heartbreaks with a misogynistic edge, she flips the narrative, demonstrating how young Black women navigate love and relationships in the social media age.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still Over It is a story about how the pursuit of love can often be a losing game, told by a Black woman who’s experienced the pain of living in a racist society filled with misogynoir. As music and culture journalist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/deasia_paige?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DeAsia Paige" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>DeAsia Paige</u></a>, puts it, “Summer Walker’s vulnerability throughout Still Over It validates that pain. By highlighting her experiences, [she] offers some Black women the rare opportunity to see themselves, and that brand of storytelling is what’s making the 25-year-old singer a rising leader in contemporary R&B.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Walker burst onto the scene back in 2018 with her mixtape, Last Day of Summer. The Atlanta native’s second album—instantly beloved by fans upon its release—is the full embodiment of “hell has no fury like a woman scorned.” Tapping into the energy of reality television shows such as Love & Hip Hop and the Real Housewives franchise, Walker charts through the journey of her split with her former boyfriend and the father of her child, popular Atlanta producer London on da Track. The former couple memorably teamed up for her last project, her 2019 smash-hit debut Over It.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">London on da Track not only contributes to half of this new album as a producer; he’s Walker’s muse and the source of her anguish and heartbreak. When she delivers lines like, “How could you make me spend my whole fucking pregnancy alone?” she’s talking directly to him, and the drama is both deeply intimate and fully public.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You don’t have to guess if something is love. Love is shown through actions,” Walker wrote in a message to Apple Music about the project. “Stop making excuses for people who don’t show up for you. Don’t ignore the red flags. And don’t think you have to stay somewhere ’cause you can’t find better—you can, and you will. Don’t settle for less—you don’t deserve it, and neither does your family.”</p><img alt="summer walker performs at the novo" title="Summer Walker Performs At The Novo" width=5160 height=3336 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/summer-walker-performs-at-the-novo-by-microsoft-on-november-news-photo-1642701490.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jerritt Clark</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her public and very tumultuous narrative won over her growing fan base. Each song builds on the last, detailing the stages of grief that come from heartbreak. In the album’s opening track, “Bitter,” Walker directly addresses the public interest in her relationship with London and talks about her spats with the other women in London’s life via social media (“So why you puttin’ on for the Shade Room and Insta?” she sings). The song ends with a voicemail from Cardi B, advising Walker to “Put that drama in your music.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The track hit a nerve with fans, because it talks about something we can all relate to: loss. Whether it be the death of a loved one, the loss of a job, the end of a relationship, loss is universal. It can be an overwhelming feeling, and for most of us, denial and anger are the first two pit stops.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some of the best moments on Still Over It are tracks like “Unloyal,” arguably one of the strongest R&B singles of the year, during which Walker and Ari Lennox combine soulfulness and rage, highlighting the emotional hoops women jump through for love. Women, particularly Black women, are often expected to give everything of themselves in the name of love, and sometimes, we lose.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On the last song, “Ciara’s Prayer,” the singer finally reaches a place of acceptance. The title refers to the prayer Ciara famously used to pull her husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, which went viral when she finally revealed it after years of fans asking. As a fan pointed out on social media, the singer’s prayer was not just about finding a man to love, but also a call to women to remember their worth. It’s evident that Walker wants fans to take note of her mistakes and avoid settling for less. Inspiring yet relatable, the track works as a culmination to the album, bringing together all Walker’s feelings, and fans immediately connected to it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Still Over It is a masterful soundtrack to Summer Walker’s life, but it’s also a narrative that so many women live, breathe, and experience,” music and cultural journalist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/WannasWorld data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wanna Thompson" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Wanna Thompson</u></a> says. Walker puts her emotions on display, Thompson says, and she doesn’t apologize for her delivery. “This album holds up a mirror to Black women who can relate to Walker’s ballads and anthems that detail the inner workings of going through it, but also, surviving it all.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The best breakup tracks can offer haunting reminders of the anger and disbelief that can stem from lost love. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/Robyn_Mowatt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robyn Mowatt" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Robyn Mowatt</u></a>, a staff writer at Okayplayer, agrees that the album provides a way for Black women to reflect on their own emotional experiences. “Walker’s lyrical content on this release allows Black women the autonomy to stand in harsh feelings whilst standing in their femininity—which isn’t a small feat,” Mowatt says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both music journalists also highlight how Walker’s lived experiences paint an intimate picture in the same vein as R&B singers of another era, including Mary J. Blige, Faith Evans, and Keyshia Cole.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I can relate to all of this. This album reflects so many of the same sentiments I’ve felt from dealing with the bumps and bruises that go along with dating. It has allowed me to revisit my pain and agony, but, on the other hand, provided playlist-worthy tracks to help me get through it, whether I have a man or not. Walker is a gifted storyteller, and on Still Over It, it’s at her most vulnerable state where she finds strength, singing for herself while echoing the pain of other women who have been wronged.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiZoql6o7vOpKpmpaWotqR7wGxvcWhjbYZ3e9KupKadomLEorjKnqlmq6Seua15zq%2Bcq2WZqXqiuMGupGado6iuuns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsummer-walker-still-over-it-album-essay.html&text=Summer%20Walker%27s%20%27Still%20Over%20It%27%20Cements%20Her%20as%20the%20Reigning%20Queen%20of%20Heartbreak&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsummer-walker-still-over-it-album-essay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsummer-walker-still-over-it-album-essay.html&title=Summer%20Walker%27s%20%27Still%20Over%20It%27%20Cements%20Her%20as%20the%20Reigning%20Queen%20of%20Heartbreak" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsummer-walker-still-over-it-album-essay.html&title=Summer%20Walker%27s%20%27Still%20Over%20It%27%20Cements%20Her%20as%20the%20Reigning%20Queen%20of%20Heartbreak" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsummer-walker-still-over-it-album-essay.html&title=Summer%20Walker%27s%20%27Still%20Over%20It%27%20Cements%20Her%20as%20the%20Reigning%20Queen%20of%20Heartbreak" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsummer-walker-still-over-it-album-essay.html&description=Summer%20Walker%27s%20%27Still%20Over%20It%27%20Cements%20Her%20as%20the%20Reigning%20Queen%20of%20Heartbreak" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chic-white-bags-summer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Chicest Bags for Right Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kit-harington-rose-leslie-wedding-date-location-guests-ring-dress-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Wedding Guide to Date, Location, Dress, Rings and Guest List">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
