We all think we know what menopause is going to feel like, but still, we are shocked at the changes, at a body that re-distributes weight, that holds on to every slice of bread we eat, that gives us paunches and pouches that we never used to have.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If I know anything about men, it’s that they don’t see the things we see when we look in the mirror. They embrace curves and softness, all the things that make us feminine.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It may be that your husband is gently suggesting the gym not so much to change your outside, but – I suspect – to change your insides, to change how you feel about yourself.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The thing is, life isn’t much fun when we hate our bodies and hate ourselves. I don’t know what it will take for you to love yourself, but I can share my own experience, which is that I spent years hating my body, wishing I was thinner, thinking I was too big, too much, that life would only work for me if I was slim.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There have been periods in my life when I have lost the weight, and apart from the initial thrill of being able to fit into everything I wanted to wear, I quickly discovered that I still didn’t like myself, that I was harder on myself than anyone else.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Until I was brave enough to do the work – therapy, meditation, lots and lots of reading about how to live a happy life, and perhaps most importantly, putting the focus on myself and my issues rather than trying to blame someone else – I couldn't be happy.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Until we love ourselves, with our paunches, our chin whiskers, our varicose veins, our warmth, our curiosity, our ability to give, all the magical gifts that we, as women, are lucky to have, we will never be happy with our partners, or our lives.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Your husband is clearly on a journey of his own, which is a wonderful thing for him, and frightening for you. I can feel his love for you in this letter, and am urging you to start a journey of your own to learn to love yourself.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It may be that exercise is part of that journey, it may be that you decide to accept yourself exactly as you are. Either way, this is a glorious tip from the universe, that it’s time for you to figure out YOU. I send you much love, and strength.</p>&nbsp;<p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Dear Jane,</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>I have two sons by two different men – the second of whom I am now happily married to.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>My former partner, who is my first son’s father, has also gone on and remarried to a lovely woman who I get on with very well.

But on the past few occasions, my ex’s family have basically pretended as though neither of my sons exist. They shower his daughter with gifts and praise, but do nothing for his son. I understand (a bit) if they don’t want to give my younger son gifts and so on, but their behavior is really started to take a toll on my eldest – who no longer wants to spend time with his dad’s family.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>I have tried to mention it to them a few times, only to be told that I’m ungrateful and that I can’t be expected to have everyone else doting on my children.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>I don’t want my son to lose his bond with his father’s side of the family, but can’t help but feel as though they’re forcing him out?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>How do I talk them round?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>From,</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Becoming Unblended</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dear Becoming Unblended,</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>Dear Jane's Sunday service</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>Learning to accept ourselves, to love ourselves, is one of the primary keys to a peaceful life.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>We spend so much time focusing on love, on loving others, rarely do we think about what it means to love ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For those of us who grew up filled with self-hatred and shame, it’s a difficult journey.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But untold freedom and glory awaits when we are willing to do the hard work of figuring out who we are, and loving that person whole-heartedly.</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/femail/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>I feel your pain in this letter. There is nothing as bad as seeing your children rejected, particularly by a family that is supposed to love them. Blessed are we, who are lucky enough to have modern blended families who recognize that families come in all shapes and sizes, all sexualities and colors, bound together by loyalty and love, by the knowledge that the logical family is not just blood, but who we choose.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Your son is already telling you what you need to do. As hard as it may feel, your job as a mother is to raise good adults who can go into the world, and fly.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>You can’t always protect your children from hardships and rejection, and in fact, experiencing the hard things will create resilience and drive. But not when those hard things from his grandparents, aunts and uncles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The modern blended family can be a wonderful thing. I had a very difficult time in the early days, dealing with my husband’s first family, but now we have shared Christmases together, birthdays, and it is wonderful for the children.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But to make this work in real life, rather than on a TV show, everyone has to be on board, everyone has to treat the children with love and respect. Your husband’s family have not done this, and he is the one who needs to talk to them, if it’s important to him that this relationship between his son and his family, continue.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If they can’t see the pain they are causing, I urge you to stop the blended vacations and shared celebrations.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Your boys can still maintain a great relationship with their dad, and with any members of his family that are willing to welcome them, but you do not, and must not, continue to blend if your sons are being rejected.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2Rcm1qbmNmfIWRoItkg3l%2BenqpwdKbmKecXZmupXnBqJtmnJWowbO72J6bZot1jXqNlaV%2BZaGsnaE%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdear-jane-husband-dad-bod-destroyed-sex-life-html.html&text=DEAR%20JANE%3a%20My%20husband%20transformed%20his%20dad%20bod%20and%20is%20now%20a%20muscular%20hunk%20-%20it%27s%20completely%20destroyed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdear-jane-husband-dad-bod-destroyed-sex-life-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdear-jane-husband-dad-bod-destroyed-sex-life-html.html&title=DEAR%20JANE%3a%20My%20husband%20transformed%20his%20dad%20bod%20and%20is%20now%20a%20muscular%20hunk%20-%20it%27s%20completely%20destroyed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdear-jane-husband-dad-bod-destroyed-sex-life-html.html&title=DEAR%20JANE%3a%20My%20husband%20transformed%20his%20dad%20bod%20and%20is%20now%20a%20muscular%20hunk%20-%20it%27s%20completely%20destroyed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdear-jane-husband-dad-bod-destroyed-sex-life-html.html&title=DEAR%20JANE%3a%20My%20husband%20transformed%20his%20dad%20bod%20and%20is%20now%20a%20muscular%20hunk%20-%20it%27s%20completely%20destroyed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdear-jane-husband-dad-bod-destroyed-sex-life-html.html&description=DEAR%20JANE%3a%20My%20husband%20transformed%20his%20dad%20bod%20and%20is%20now%20a%20muscular%20hunk%20-%20it%27s%20completely%20destroyed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nfl-apologises-cheeky-slip-players-are-shown-naked-tv-if-i-was.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NFL apologises for cheeky slip as players are shown naked on TV  if I was a woman, this would ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./n-room-incidents-related-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="! 6N">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
