Working for 10 NCAA men’s basketball tournaments, and he contributed to CBS’s&nbsp;coverage of the Olympic Winter Games.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read About:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Josina Anderson Wiki, Bio, Age, Married, Husband, Boyfriend and Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Spending a total of 10 years at CBS Sports and was the lead college football play-by-play announcer from 1997 until 1999 also being the announcer for the Boston Red Sox. Radio&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of his best work he has done NFL games for ESPN Radio from 2013 until 2015.

He was one of the attendees of the Special Screening Of The HBO Documentary "GLICKMAN" in 2013, which was hosted by Syracuse University members in New York City. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-179 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>From left to right- Ian Eagle, Mike Breen, and Sean McDonough at the&nbsp;screening of the HBO documentary Glickman&nbsp;on 24 August 2013 in New York City.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The reporter was photographed along with his fellow sportscasters including Mike Green and Ian Eagle at the documentary premiere&nbsp;at Time Warner Center Screening Room.</p><p style=text-align:justify>And in recent times, Sean was&nbsp;honored George Arents Award by his alma mater, Syracuse University for his great work in sports journalism.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>How Much Is Sean McDonough's Net Worth?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The 56-year-old reporter&nbsp;has&nbsp;a net worth of $ 2 million but with his recent takeover in his job as a new MNF&nbsp;announcer that might increase over the years. Sports Illustrated named Sean the Broadcast Team of the Year in the annual SI Media Awards. He is also the president of the “Sean McDonough Charitable Foundation,” with nearly given nearly $3 million to 129 children’s charities. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Do Not Miss:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Cari Champion Age, Married, Husband, Boyfriend, ESPN, Fired, Salary</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>The newscaster recently signed a new contract in 2016 of May for the role of MNF lead&nbsp;announcer, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his salary increased&nbsp;as well on that deal</a>. It is unsure how much to be exact but with the highest-paid anchor of ESPN is a few million he is likely to get the same or less.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>According to the 2018 reports of the Boston Globe Magazine, Sean is looking forward to ally with his close associates on and off the camera at ESPN’s college football team.<br>The reporter’s agent, Sandy Montag also reportedly made it clear that the decision from moving to ESPN show Monda Night Football to its college team was on a mutual decision. Sandy always thinks that Sean's brand is college sports, and its something&nbsp;where he belongs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As of 2019, McDonough&nbsp;decided to go back into calling Red Sox Games. From 1988 up until 2004, he called Red Sox games&nbsp;on Channels 38, 68, and 25. He has also been a prominent voice on ESPN’s college football and basketball broadcasts for several years as of now. He recently had a two-year stint on “Monday Night Football. Likewise, with him calling the game for Red Sox, McDonough said he expects to call 30 or 32 games on the Red Sox flagship radio network.</p><p style=text-align:justify>According to Payscale, the average annual salary of an American sportscaster is $55,000, and Sean's more than three decades of working experience certainly escalates his remunerative paychecks. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Sean McDonough Married or Single?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Sean is a man who is&nbsp;mostly quiet about his personal life. Mainly a workaholic and more interested in the game of sports than the game of romance. Though he does not have a fan page and a social network of his own, he has not to comment on any rumors about him, dating a girlfriend at the moment. He is also not married or is there any records of him having a wife in any wiki sources that are reliable enough.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-710 data-method=ai-placeholders class=ezoic-autoinsert-ad></span><p style=text-align:justify>The news anchor is likely too focused on his career on being a lead announcer on ESPN to be dating anyone at the moment. He may be gay, but without his official statement, we cannot be sure about anything. His one and true love is his passion for sportscasting and may not be interested in physical human contact at the moment.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Also, Know More About:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Randy Scott ESPN, Wiki, Age, Height, Married, Wife, Girlfriend, Dating</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>It just seems he's very much focused on his career rather than other aspects that might be a sort of distraction to him. Or he could be having a secret relationship with someone, as of 2019. So yet again, unless he comes forth, we cannot be sure about anything.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Short Bio</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The sports commenter, age 57, was born on 13 May 1962 in Boston, Massachusetts, as per wiki.
