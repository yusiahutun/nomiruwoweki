"We've never been Scientologists, we've never been swingers." Jada added, "that's a very specific lifestyle!"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:39a48873-6201-5f5c-9913-1556cd3e15b8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:fa4715f8-af61-53b7-a844-8c23afe5a6f2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/49/5by4/2018/10/22/49939735c1655ce094c4e3ca57257717_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook Watch</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Will Reveals 'Most Poisonous Aspect' of Relationship with Jada</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>With that out of the way, it's time for a deep dive into the rest of the 30-minute chat.</p><p>The episode opened with Will and Jada talking about the "turning point" in their relationship, as they both spoke about how Jada's 40th birthday celebration changed everything for the couple.</p><p>"Your 40th birthday was my low point," said Will. He went on to detail how he went all out for her party, booking Mary J. Blige to perform and presenting her with a video filled with soundbites from Jada's late grandmother that she had never seen before.</p><p>"She's listening to these never before heard tapes in front of all of these people, she's holding it together, I had Mary J. Blige performing and she's having a really difficult emotional time," Will recalled. After the party, Jada made it clear she didn't want to continue the festivities the following day, even though Will had more planned.</p><p>"She's like, it's my birthday and she told me that the party was the most ridiculous display of my ego," he said. "Crushed, right? And to this day I know I was crushed because it was true. It wasn't a party for her. When she called me on that, that's when I snapped and that's the only time you ever heard me snap. I snapped in front of <strong><a href=#>Willow</a></strong> and Willow starts crying and she's like, 'JUST FIGURE IT OUT!'"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Facebook Video.</p><p>Jada said that moment made her reevaluate her life and decide to live more authentically from then on. "I was crying so hard after your birthday, my eyes looked so red I took pictures of myself, I was like, I want to remember this," said Will.</p><p>Another moment of realization for Will came when Willow decided she didn't want to be on tour anymore during the success of "Whip My Hair." He explained, "We were at the top of the world and she was like, 'Okay, I'm done daddy.' I was like, 'Sweetie, you can't be done ... you made a commitment to Mr. Jay-Z.' She was like, 'No, daddy you made a commitment to Mr. Jay-Z.'"</p><p>She then shaved off all her hair, which he called "a deep protest." Will added, "I had a crazy realization in that moment, I was building what I wanted for her and she tried all the different ways to say I don't want that."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1deea70e-bff6-5f8d-b7ff-57c1aaa8b4ac data-container-ref=toofab:article:fa4715f8-af61-53b7-a844-8c23afe5a6f2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/28/5by4/2018/06/04/28361421829c590b8ebb14f818955405_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Willow Smith Calls 'Whip My Hair' a 'Really Terrible Experience' While Getting Real With Jaden About Their Parents' Parenting</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>To move forward as a couple, Smith said he and Jada had to "destroy our marriage," but added that divorce was "never even a consideration" for either of them. "I had been divorced before," he added, "I wasn't getting divorced again."</p><p>"We broke up within our marriage and got back together again and had to rebuild with new rules and something way completely different," he continued. "I took off for two years, I worked on myself, I read 50 books on marriage, relationships and behavioral psychology. I shut down for two entire years to see what was I doing wrong."</p><p>"Ultimately to have a successful relationship, you have to have a relationship with a human being," said Jada. Added Will, "Will Smith is a character, but deep down inside I was an insecure little boy who wanted Jada to say I was great and if she didn't say I was great, the dragon came out."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e13a14fd-d4f0-59d6-8f94-e71fe7cf7cd3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:fa4715f8-af61-53b7-a844-8c23afe5a6f2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/12/5by4/2018/06/11/1253a0ae66a85edab6dd414696182cc1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jada Pinkett Smith Reveals Sex Toy 'Addiction' and Willow Says No to Monogamy on 'Red Table Talk'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The two eventually decided to "throw away the concept of marriage," with Will saying they don't even call themselves married anymore. "It's a life partnership that we know is for this lifetime," said Jada.</p><p>"Whatever she needs, she can count on me for the rest of my life," explained Will. "There's nothing that could happen that we won't be together and love each other. And it's not because we're just saying it, it's because we've cracked each other's heads wide open."</p><p>"The pain Jada caused me was the pain I needed to survive to learn how to be happy," said Will, adding, "I've never been happier in my life."</p><p>He ended the episode by telling his wife how proud he was of her success with "Red Table Talk," telling her that "it is the joy that I have always hoped you would have."</p><a id=gallery-link-087dd8e0-ff95-5101-8f12-e70862037f18 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:087dd8e0-ff95-5101-8f12-e70862037f18 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20180611_2a8ed5ca5f2655359ba36605576ab5ab data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:fa4715f8-af61-53b7-a844-8c23afe5a6f2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2a/4by3/2018/06/11/2a8ed5ca5f2655359ba36605576ab5ab_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7kGlma3FfrLatuIyspKKsmGKwrbHAq6pmraBiwKS1xKerqKSfnMZuv9aipaCdomK%2FtrnOq6pmp55iv6awjK2Ym6SVYsGiuMpmqZ6ulZa5tHnMmqmroZGcsm64zrBkqaeZo8Fw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwill-smith-clears-up-scientology-swinger-rumors-on-red-table-talk-reveals-marriage-low-point.html&text=Will%20Smith%20Addresses%20Scientology%2c%20Swinger%20Rumors%20on%20Jada%27s%20%27Red%20Table%20Talk%2c%27%20Reveals%20Marriage%20%27Low%20P&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwill-smith-clears-up-scientology-swinger-rumors-on-red-table-talk-reveals-marriage-low-point.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwill-smith-clears-up-scientology-swinger-rumors-on-red-table-talk-reveals-marriage-low-point.html&title=Will%20Smith%20Addresses%20Scientology%2c%20Swinger%20Rumors%20on%20Jada%27s%20%27Red%20Table%20Talk%2c%27%20Reveals%20Marriage%20%27Low%20P" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwill-smith-clears-up-scientology-swinger-rumors-on-red-table-talk-reveals-marriage-low-point.html&title=Will%20Smith%20Addresses%20Scientology%2c%20Swinger%20Rumors%20on%20Jada%27s%20%27Red%20Table%20Talk%2c%27%20Reveals%20Marriage%20%27Low%20P" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwill-smith-clears-up-scientology-swinger-rumors-on-red-table-talk-reveals-marriage-low-point.html&title=Will%20Smith%20Addresses%20Scientology%2c%20Swinger%20Rumors%20on%20Jada%27s%20%27Red%20Table%20Talk%2c%27%20Reveals%20Marriage%20%27Low%20P" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwill-smith-clears-up-scientology-swinger-rumors-on-red-table-talk-reveals-marriage-low-point.html&description=Will%20Smith%20Addresses%20Scientology%2c%20Swinger%20Rumors%20on%20Jada%27s%20%27Red%20Table%20Talk%2c%27%20Reveals%20Marriage%20%27Low%20P" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./zahn-mcclarnon-married-wife-gay-family-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zahn McClarnon Married, Wife, Gay, Family, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jamila-wideman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jamila Wideman dating?
