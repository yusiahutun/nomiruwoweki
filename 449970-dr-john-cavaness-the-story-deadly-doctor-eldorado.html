But, of course, it was not always like that and like any <a href=#>other murderer</a>, his story starts from somewhere.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7dc028956d79eb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jana Reynolds's story: What really happened and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>John was born in 1925 in the small Southern Illinois <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">town of Eldorado</a>. His parents were Peck and Noma Cavaness, and he was the only child in the <a href=#>family</a>.</p><p class=align-left>John's father trained him to stand for himself and tackle his challenges by himself, which was a great life lesson for the young John. Such traits made him competitive and successful in virtually everything he attempted.</p><p class=align-left>Dr John's small size did not deter him from taking on significant challenges. He excelled in <a href=#>football</a> and proved to be strong in physical fights.</p><p class=align-left>The doctor was fortunate enough to come from a wealthy family that wasn't affected by the depression. Therefore, his parents had sufficient money to take him to high school and college. They also did not have any problem taking him to medical school, where he earned his medical skills.</p><p class=align-left>Dr John was part of the United States Army (joined after completing high school) and took part in <a href=#>World</a> War II. After leaving the army (honourably discharged), he got an opportunity to study medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1afb04aa2916c153.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Camm family murders story: Where is David Camm now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, after coming back home from medical practice, he was abandoned by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his first wife</a>, Helen Jean. He found solace with a friend (Mariann Newberry), a nurse at Barnes Jewish Hospital. They married on October 3, 1952.</p><p class=align-left>The doctor was abusive in the marriage and had several domestic violence situations. Nevertheless, they had their first child, Mark, in 1954, and the second, Kevin Dale, followed in 1956.</p><p class=align-left>Dr John created a strong reputation in his town as he treated people in impoverished communities. The doctor and his wife had their third son, Dean Dale Cavaness, in 1962.</p><p class=align-left>Despite John's infidelity, Mariann remained married to him. She even gave birth to another third child, Patrick Dale Cavaness, in 1966.</p><h2>Life after divorce</h2><p class=align-left>It was pretty strange that despite Dr John moving on with another woman, his wife, Mariann, did not seek <a href=#>a divorce</a>. However, a 1972 incident would push Mariann to the wall and finally request a divorce.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cbc3959961e04aba.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fred Grabbe's story: Background, what happened, and where is he today?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The doctor caused an accident while drunk and killed a man with his 10-month-old baby. Fortunately, the man’s wife survived the accident, but she was critically injured. After investigators reviewed the case, they found out that the doctor was intoxicated and charged him with reckless homicide.</p><p class=align-left>And this was the breaking point for his wife, who filed for divorce. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mariann left </a>with her children to St. Louis. Even though Dr John Cavaness had committed a grave crime, the community still loved and believed in him.</p><p class=align-left>Throughout the 1970s, the doctor's business lost its glory, and he was not making as much money as before. This way, he was falling behind in child payments to his wife.</p><p class=align-left>His son Mark struggled after his parents divorced. He dropped out of school and went to work with his father on his farm. However, the doctor never got along with him and always declared that he was a good for nothing post smoker.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f308b807409bf58.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gavon Ramsay: What happened to the teen who murdered Margaret Douglas?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When Mark's brothers visited him on Good Friday, they couldn't find him in his trailer. After looking around, they discovered his body in a field on the Cavaness farm. He was shot in the head, and animals had already destroyed much of his body. The murder in Little Egypt was shocking to the residents that hardly heard of such news.</p><p class=align-left>The death was reported as an accidental or even suicide, but the police suspected that Dr John might have been involved. However, they did not have evidence to charge him with the murder.

As a result, he got into alcohol, and he went to rehabilitation at some point.</p><p class=align-left>Sean also frequently visited his father at his home, hoping to gain acceptance. However, it never happened, and his body was also discovered dead in a remote area of Saint Louis, once referred to as Times Beach.

They narrowed no him after evidence suggested that his car was circling the area where Sean’s body was discovered. Witnesses even recognized the man in the car as Dr John.</p><p class=align-left>Dale was charged with first-degree murder. The investigators concluded the motive was the life insurance policies that the doctor had taken against his sons.</p><h2>What was Dr John’s story of what happened?</h2><p class=align-left>Dr John claimed that, indeed, he was with his son the day he died, but he was not the killer. Instead, Sean asked him to drive to the area and requested him for his gun, which he used to shoot himself.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a3d9a2629ff95d43.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Eddie Ray Routh?

Ballistic evidence showed that the gunshot wound couldn't be self-inflicted. And the fact that Dale hid Sean's items and the gun on his property <a href=#>made him guilty</a>. Dale even partied the next day and acted normal despite knowing that his son was dead.</p><p class=align-left>In November 1985, Dale was found guilty of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death in Missouri's gas chamber. However, he hanged himself in his cell before going to the gas chamber. Also, John was never charged for his other son, Mark's murder.</p><h2>Quick facts about Dr John Cavaness</h2><li>When was Dr John arrested?
