He is known for pushing the limits with his jokes, getting away with sarcastic and cutting remarks as his dummies are the ones who’re usually at fault.</p><p>The ingeniousness behind his performance is his unique way of creating personas and characters that you recognize and can’t help but love.</p><p>Even when his puppets represent a character that is quite dreadful, he manages to get away with jokes that no one else would dare to try.</p><p>As of September 2023, Jeff Dunham’s net worth is estimated to be $140 Million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeff-dunham-facts></span>Jeff Dunham Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Jeff’s first big appearance on TV was in 1976, when he was interviewed by Bill O’Reilly, the local TV <a href=#>News</a> reporter.</li><li>Dunham was adopted in 1962 by a devout Christian couple and was their only child.</li><li>His big break came after Johnny Carson invited Jeff and his sidekick “Walter” onto the Tonight Show in 1990.</li><li>Jeff appeared in many TV ads during his high school years and later became famous for his 1996 Hertz commercial.</li><li>In 1985, he appeared on Broadway in a burlesque variety show called “Sugar Babies,” starring Mickey Rooney.</li><li>Jeff stole a library book, “Fun With Ventriloquism,” in 1972 and has never given it back.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeffrey Douglas Dunham was <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dunham data-lasso-id=102091 data-wpel-link=external data-cke-saved->born on 18 April 1962</a>, in Dallas, Texas, and was adopted at three months old.</p><p>He was taken in as a baby by a devout Christian family. His father, Howard Dunham, was a real estate appraiser, and his mother, Joyce, was a homemaker. He was an only child.</p><p>This could be the reason behind his finding a ventriloquist doll great company after it was given to him when he was 9 years old.</p><p>Jeff received the doll for Christmas, and very shortly afterward, checked out a book from the library on ventriloquism, which, he has revealed, is still in his possession to this day.</p><p>Big inspirations for him as a child were Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd, who were the ventriloquism dolls of Edgar Bergen.</p><p>From early on, Jeff performed in multiple commercials while still only in high school. By the time Jeff entered university, he was earning over $70,000 annually.</p><p>It is little wonder that he was voted most likely to succeed in high school.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even with Jeff’s jokes being a bit risqué, the puppets seemed to subdue the jokes. In 1976, he was interviewed by a local <a href=#>news</a> reporter and, from there, his popularity skyrocketed.</p><p>This interview got him his first big job for a Datsun dealership in Dallas while still in high school.</p><p>Once enrolled at university, Jeff soon became busy juggling schoolwork and performances. He would fly all around the country on weekends and attend over 100 shows per year.</p><p>In 1985, Jeff got his big break, being asked to join the Broadway show, Sugar Babies.</p><p>After graduating, he continued to perform in comedy clubs around the Southwest. After a while, Jeff realized that the main problem with his acts was the lack of development in his humor.</p><p>Jeff was inspired by comedians like Jerry Seinfeld and took advice from more experienced performers. He became friends with the owner of The Comedy and Magic Club, where he was able to practice his new comedic acts. This was his first step away from G-rated jokes and on to a more adult-like theme.</p><p>After lots of appearances at clubs around Los Angeles, Jeff finally felt confident enough to appear on The Tonight Show in 1990. Jeff’s appearance went extremely well and was the biggest break of his career.</p><p>In 1996, he appeared with&nbsp;Ellen DeGeneres on the Ellen show and went on to appear on the Tonight show four more times.</p><p>He appeared on Comedy Central Presents in his first solo performance, which was super successful. After a few more shows, Comedy Central decided to air “Arguing with Myself”, which went on to sell two million DVDs worldwide.</p><p>Jeff traveled globally with his characters, easily crossing language barriers. This culminated in his 2008 shows performing in front of tens of thousands of people in huge arenas.</p><p><strong>More <a href=#>Professional</a> Comedians:</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeff-dunham%e2%80%99s-career-earnings></span>Jeff Dunham’s Career Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeff Dunham is cagey about what he earns, but we estimate that he receives a salary of between $15 million and $30 million annually.</p><p>Here’s an estimated overview of Jeff Dunham’s annual income:</p><ul><li>Jeff Dunham’s Salary in 2015 – $15 million</li><li>Jeff Dunham’s Salary in 2016 – $20 million</li><li>Jeff Dunham’s Salary in 2017 – $26 million</li><li>Jeff Dunham’s Salary in 2018 – $17.2 million</li><li>Jeff Dunham’s Salary in 2019 – $25 million</li><li>Jeff Dunham’s Salary in 2020 – $28.5 million</li><li>Jeff Dunham’s Salary in 2021 – $27 million</li><li>Jeff Dunham’s Salary in 2022 – $30 million</li></ul><p>With Jeff’s popularity with a huge segment of the TV audience, he’ll not have any trouble maintaining and even increasing his earnings in the future.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jeff-dunham%e2%80%99s-net-worth-annually></span>Jeff Dunham’s Net Worth Annually<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeff is an astute <a href=#>businessman</a> as well as a highly talented performer.
