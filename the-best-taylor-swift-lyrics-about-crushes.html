From the thrilling rush of a newfound crush to the nostalgic reminiscing of a past lover, Swift navigates us through her lyrical labyrinth of romance and longing. This article hones in on a particular nuance of Swift's anthology: her masterful depiction of crushes in a selection of her songs.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>In "I Think He Knows", a catchy tune from the "Lover" album, Swift gives us a peek into the thrill and anxiety that accompanies the early stages of a crush. The song bursts with the exuberance of realizing your feelings for someone and suspecting they might feel the same way too.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The lyric, "He got my heartbeat skipping down 16th Avenue" encapsulates the heady mix of exhilaration and nervousness one experiences when crushing hard on someone. Her references to "lyrical smile" and "indigo eyes" paint a vivid image of her object of affection, bringing the listener directly into her feelings. It's a song that captures the essence of a crush: the intense focus on the other person, the anticipation, the hope that they might feel the same way.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>"State of Grace," a stand-out track from the album "Red," takes a slightly different approach. Here, Swift transports us into a realm of blissful infatuation, and the seemingly divine connection one feels at the start of a potential romantic liaison.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The lyrics, "up in your room and our slates are clean, just twin fire signs" evoke the pure joy and innocence of a new relationship when everything is exciting and untainted by heartbreak or disappointment. It's an anthem that speaks to the divine-like feeling of meeting someone new and feeling an instant connection — a crush that feels like destiny. In "State of Grace," Swift manages to capture that first flush of attraction where everything feels possible, and every shared moment feels like a sacred connection.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-108 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Meanwhile, "Blank Space," a track off her groundbreaking pop album "1989," embraces the whirlwind and the seemingly inevitable crash of a fiery romance. It's not a crush in the sweet, innocent sense but rather the overpowering allure of a potential lover who might be more danger than delight.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>"I can make the bad guys good for a weekend" — Swift admits to the magnetic pull of a crush, knowing full well the consequences that might follow. The song plays out like a warning and a welcome all at once, presenting the paradox that often accompanies crushes. It’s a testament to how we can be drawn to people even when we know they're bad news — the classic tale of the heart wanting what it wants, despite better judgment.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Each of these songs, from their catchy hooks to their relatable lyrics, offers a unique perspective on the concept of having a crush. They delve into the giddy highs, the nerve-wracking uncertainties, and the reckless allure that make up the mosaic of attraction. Swift, through her craft, invites us to experience the crush phenomenon in all its exhilarating complexity. And trust me, we've barely scratched the surface. Stay tuned for more.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>In the mellow, guitar-strumming tune "Invisible String" from her critically acclaimed album "Folklore," Swift shifts our perspective to a more mystical plane. Here, the crush isn't just a spontaneous spark of attraction but a connection that seems to have been written in the stars.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The lyrics "One single thread of gold tied me to you" speak of an unseen bond, a predestined pull towards another person. It's like falling for someone even before you've met them, feeling a connection that's inexplicable yet deeply felt. This string, Swift seems to say, guides us toward people we're destined to crush on or love. This song speaks to those of us who've felt an unspoken, almost cosmic connection with a crush, a pull that feels bigger than both of you.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>One of Swift's biggest hits, "You Belong With Me," presents a quintessential high-school-crush scenario. This upbeat, irresistible track from her "Fearless" album talks about the painful yet familiar situation of having feelings for someone who is in a relationship with someone else.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>"She wears high heels, I wear sneakers. She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers" — these lyrics perfectly capture the heartache of feeling unseen by your crush. Swift illustrates the longing and insecurity of unrequited love in a manner that feels achingly relatable. It's a song for anyone who's ever harbored a secret crush, quietly hoping for them to realize that what they're looking for has been right there all along.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>From her album "Reputation," "Gorgeous" is a synth-heavy tune that reflects the flustered, tongue-tied stage of a crush. It's a side of Swift that leans more towards the humorous and relatable awkwardness one experiences when they're around a person they're incredibly attracted to.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>"You're so gorgeous, I can't say anything to your face," Swift croons, encapsulating the experience of being so enamored with someone that words fail you. It's a playful yet sincere expression of how it feels to be absolutely smitten by someone to the point of speechlessness. This song will resonate with anyone who's been so taken by a crush that it's left them fumbling for words.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Finally, in "Enchanted" from her album "Speak Now," Swift captures the fairytale-like magic of meeting a crush for the first time. It's about that moment when you lock eyes with someone across the room and feel an instantaneous connection, a pull that leaves you wanting more.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The lyrics "I was enchanted to meet you" echo the mesmerizing effect a crush can have, making you feel as if you're under a spell. Swift masterfully encapsulates that moment of magical attraction when you're hoping, praying even, that the other person feels the same way. It's a song that perfectly captures the sense of wonder, hope, and yearning that come with the onset of a crush.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Navigating through Taylor Swift's discography, it becomes evident that she has a song for nearly every stage of a crush — from the initial butterflies, through the whirlwind of emotions, to the hopeful longing. Swift's songs provide a comforting soundtrack for anyone navigating the rollercoaster of having a crush, and her nuanced storytelling only amplifies the relatability of her lyrics. The way she's able to capture these universal experiences in her music is, quite frankly, one of her many talents that set her apart. Whether it's a song about the intoxicating pull of a bad boy or a ditty about unrequited love, there's no denying: Swift is the queen of capturing the experience of crushing in all its sweet, painful, exhilarating glory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyjuM6gZq2glWKvpr%2FTZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWcrr%2Bqr9JmmJunpal6pL7UrJ%2Beqw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-best-taylor-swift-lyrics-about-crushes.html&text=The%20best%20Taylor%20Swift%20lyrics%20about%20crushes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-best-taylor-swift-lyrics-about-crushes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-taylor-swift-lyrics-about-crushes.html&title=The%20best%20Taylor%20Swift%20lyrics%20about%20crushes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-best-taylor-swift-lyrics-about-crushes.html&title=The%20best%20Taylor%20Swift%20lyrics%20about%20crushes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-taylor-swift-lyrics-about-crushes.html&title=The%20best%20Taylor%20Swift%20lyrics%20about%20crushes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-taylor-swift-lyrics-about-crushes.html&description=The%20best%20Taylor%20Swift%20lyrics%20about%20crushes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./vanness-wu-and-yixuan-an.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanness Wu and Yixuan An">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./shopbazaar-celebrates-the-launch-of-black-iris.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ShopBAZAAR Celebrates the Launch of Black Iris">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
