The stars couldnâ€™t prolong their relationship but are jointly fulfilling the parental duty now. Yes, David and Golden are blessed with a daughter, Dakota who is seven years old. Though D.B doesnâ€™t have a wife and isnâ€™t married, his past relationship with Golden makes it clear that he isnâ€™t a gay.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Short Bio:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Born on 25 July 1969, D.B Woodside grew up in Jamaica, Queens, New York, U.S.&nbsp;He earned a degree in BA from the State University of New York at Albany.
