The woman is named Renée Ash. Renée exclusively revealed to PageSix that Monty led her to believe that their relationship was more meaningful.</p><p>“Unfortunately, he misled me on his marriage, he lied to me,” Renée told the outlet. She claimed that Monty told him that the marriage with his wife Sheri Easterling ended when it wasn’t.</p><p>“He told me that we were going to be together and have babies together,” she continues. “He even introduced me to his mom, his youngest brother and I thought we had something real. And, he told me a story of his marriage that convinced me that they were apart and in the process of getting a divorce”.</p><p>Renée revealed that she broke up with Monty Lopez in early July 2022 after several girls accused the middle-aged influencer of hitting on them in person and&nbsp;even over FaceTime. She added that the last straw was when she saw leaked footage online of&nbsp;Monty allegedly caressing a girl’s backside during a night out partying who is allegedly of 19 years old.</p><p>TikTok user @marlig_ who uploaded the video, now deleted, the young girl alleged, “Addison Rae’s dad is trying to f—k me, I swear to God”.</p><p>Ash told PageSix, “If anybody was hurting, it was me and his family. I am beyond sorry for that”. She added, “I loved him and I believed him. When I found out about the other young girls, my heart broke”. Renée also apologized for any pain the family had to endure because of this.</p><p>“I am so sorry if anything I have said has hurt his family any more than he already has,” Renée says. “And I am also sorry that he has hurt me so deeply that I believed we were in love”.</p><h3><strong>Meet Renée Ash Mother, Tracy Ash</strong></h3><p>Renée Ash not only took the last name of her mother, but also her looks.
