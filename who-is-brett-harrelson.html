He is also known as the younger brother of fellow actor Woody Harrelson. Want to learn more about him? Keep reading!</strong></p><p>Brett Harrelson is an American actor and businessman. He is often called “Woody Harrelson’s younger brother” as he is the less-known of the Harrelson brothers. Regardless, Brett has created a niche for himself in other ways. Here’s everything we know about him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Brett_Harrelson></span>Who Is Brett Harrelson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brett V. Harrelson is one-half of Hollywood’s highly acclaimed Harrelson brothers. He is an actor and businessman born June 4, 1963, in Midland, Texas, to parents Diane Lou (née Oswald) and <a href=#>Charles Voyde Harrelson</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Charles was a contract killer who committed the first judge assassination of the 20th century. He was convicted and sent to a maximum facility, where he later died while serving his life sentence.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/download-1.jpg><p>At ten years of age, Brett moved with his mother to Lebanon, Ohio, where he schooled and spent most of his early life. Brett dropped out of Lebanon High School at 17 to join the US Army, spent two years in Germany, and later returned to Lebanon to work as a legal clerk.&nbsp;</p><p>At age 22, he followed his brother Woody to California, which is when his acting career began.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Brett_Harrelson_Start_His_Career></span>How Did Brett Harrelson Start His Career?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While often associated with his renowned brother Woody Harrelson, Brett’s individuality shines through his diverse roles as he has also been in several of Hollywood’s big movies. After moving with his brother to Los Angeles, California, Brett wasn’t as lucky as his brother in finding acting success.&nbsp;</p><p>He gave up on acting for a while and pursued a career in motorcycling, which worked out pretty well for him as he ranked number 8 in the 1992 professional national rankings. Still having a flair for acting, Brett became Woody’s assistant and returned to acting. Over the years, he has featured in some Hollywood blockbusters and is passionate about acting.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Movies_and_TV_Shows_Did_Brett_Harrelson_Star_In></span>What Movies and TV Shows Did Brett Harrelson Star In?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since his Hollywood debut, Brett has starred in several movies, TV shows, and podcasts and even made a documentary about himself.

People often ask if Brett is related to Woody Harrelson due to their similar names and resemblance. The two have consistently confirmed their blood ties since their early Hollywood debut.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brett_Harrelsons_Siblings></span>Brett Harrelson’s Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Woody Harrelson is more widely known and featured in many movies than Brett, the brothers have always seemed close. However, most people do not know that there is a third Harrelson brother, Jordan, in Hollywood too.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Woodrow_Woody_Harrelson></span>Woodrow Woody Harrelson<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After moving to California, Woody gained fame for his role as a dim-witted bartender on the classic sitcom “<a href=#>Cheers</a>.” This famous American television comedy series appeared on NBC for 11 seasons from 1982 to 1993). He later got more acting roles and success in the industry and earned respect as an accomplished and magnetic film actor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woody-harrelson-1024x1024-1.jpg><p>Woody is also famous for his roles in movies like “Venom,” and “Game Change.” He is an Emmy award-winning actor whose acting skills have been highly praised over the years, with many big award nominations and wins under his belt.&nbsp;</p><p>Woody still acts today and has several rumored projects on the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jordan_Harrelson></span>Jordan Harrelson<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jordan Harrelson is the third Harrelson brother known majorly for his voice-acting skills. He was born on December 9, 1991. He has starred as a voice actor in some movies and video games, including “Well” (2016), “Paradise Lost” (2023), and “My Time at Portia” (2018).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Brett_Harrelsons_CBD_Business_Start></span>How Did Brett Harrelson’s CBD Business Start?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2020, the actor launched his Cannabidiol (CBD) brand called “Harrelson’s Own CBD.” It is a CBD-producing company that uses nanotechnology to make and design its products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/0x0.webp><p>Harrelson’s Own CBD is licensed in the United States and has gathered a rather large customer base due to the testimonials from its consumers about how fast and effective its products are.</p><p>Their slogan is “Stable. Calm. Collected. Happy.” It is said to be a verbal description of their consumers’ feelings. Since its launch, Harrelson’s Own CBD has been highly successful, and Brett himself stars in the commercials for the brand.&nbsp;</p><p>Woody also launched his weed brand in October 2022 with some A-list partners, including HBO “Real Time” host Bill Maher, hot-shot designer Thomas Schoos and the founders of Erba dispensary Jay Handal and Devon Wheeler. Their brand is named “The Woods.”&nbsp;</p><p>Brett might be the lesser-known Harrelson brother, but he sure knows how to make a path for himself in other ways apart from acting. He is not married but is a loving uncle to his nieces <a href=#>Zoe Giordano Harrelson</a>, Deni, and Makani.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZpqimsG1eceaqaudnKi8r3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-brett-harrelson.html&text=Who%20Is%20Brett%20Harrelson%3f%20-%20GistFest&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-brett-harrelson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-brett-harrelson.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brett%20Harrelson%3f%20-%20GistFest" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-brett-harrelson.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brett%20Harrelson%3f%20-%20GistFest" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-brett-harrelson.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brett%20Harrelson%3f%20-%20GistFest" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-brett-harrelson.html&description=Who%20Is%20Brett%20Harrelson%3f%20-%20GistFest" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amina-blue-inked-magazine-tyga.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amina Blue Goes Topless In Inked Magazine -- Meet the Model Who Spent the Weekend with Tyga!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-a-blade-buster.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is a blade buster?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
