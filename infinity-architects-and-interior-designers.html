To do the best and a bit more on every project is Infinity’s prime concern. Among the last year’s projects, E.Q. Technologic Head Office, Pune was the most challenging one. It was a tedious task as 86,000 sq. ft. the project was to be completed within 90 days. The client was not in India; the communication relied on electronic media. The most difficult part was correspondence over e-mail, explaining design ideas, details, etc., and getting approval from the client.</p><p>It was a technology-based project as research and understanding of new technologies and incorporating them in design was implemented. Dealing with a large number of agencies as well as designing as per U.S. standards was a strenuous job.
