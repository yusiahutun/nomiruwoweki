Angels are heavenly/ supernatural beings created by God and not humans who have earned wings in the next life for being good on earth.</p><p class=align-left>As God's intermediaries, angels deliver God's message to chosen humans, fight evil and give tours of Heaven to righteous visionaries. There are many kinds of angels, i.e. arch angels, cherubs, seraphim etc.</p><h2>Who is the first angel, according to the Bible?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/10dec2f70e1369c7.jpg><p class=align-left>It is believed that the archangel Lucifer was the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first angel created </a>by God.

Some sources, including the book of Ezekiel, have conflicting accounts.</p><p class=align-left>Nevertheless, it is believed that before Lucifer was cast out of Heaven, he held the top position in the angels' hierarchy, second to God. Ultimately, it's believed that Lucifer rebelled against God and was hurled from Heaven as punishment.</p><p class=align-left>To date, there's a debate about Lucifer’s origins and fall. Some scholars argue that Lucifer was in the cherubim class, a group of powerful angelic beings. Others say that he was a member of Seraphim, the highest order of angels led by Archangel Gabriel and Michael.</p><p class=align-left>Regardless most sources, including the Bible, agree that Lucifer held a top and important rank before his fall and was the first angel created by God.</p><h2>Who were the first three angels?</h2><p class=align-left>The first three archangels God created were Lucifer, Michael and Gabriel. Each angel led a third of the angels in Heaven.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cd77814e7859fcca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"New World Order": Pastor MacKenzie Taught that Catholic Church, USA and UN Are Agents of Satan</span></p></a><h3>1. Michael</h3><p class=align-left>Michael is one of the most powerful archangels in the Bible. He is recognized in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches recognize him as the chief angel.</p><p class=align-left>In the Bible, Michael is famous for his warrior prowess, and the Book of Daniel describes him as a great prince. Many <a href=#>Bible verses</a> show how he fearlessly fought against evil spiritual forces. In Revelation, Michael leads other angels in a battle against the wicked dragon.</p><h3>2. Gabriel</h3><p class=align-left>Gabriel is among the most powerful archangels recognized in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. He is an archangel with the power to announce God's will to humans. He is mentioned in the New Testament, the Hebrew <a href=#>Holy Bible</a> and the Quran.</p><p class=align-left>Gabriel is probably the most recognized angel in the Bible. He delivered important messages to God's people. For example, Gabriel appeared to Mary and revealed she would bear God's child, Jesus Christ. He also told Zechariah his wife Elizabeth would give birth to John the Baptist.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b62955408202dc97.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>'Men of God' Who Led Their Congregation to Their Death in Woeful Circumstances</span></p></a><h3>3. Lucifer</h3><p class=align-left>Lucifer meant star of the morning and was one of the high-ranking angels in Heaven. Other than having a significant influence and power Lucifer had great wisdom and exquisite beauty.</p><p class=align-left>But all these blinded him and made him revolt against his father. Lucifer wanted to be bigger or an equal to God but lost everything, including his<a href=#> angelic wings</a>, when he was cast out of Heaven.</p><h2>Amenadiel in the Bible</h2><p class=align-left>Amenadiel is not mentioned in the Bible, but some Christian and Judaic texts mention him. Generally, the Bible has little information about the angelic kingdom, so the fact that Amenadiel isn't mentioned doesn't mean he's nonexistent.</p><p class=align-left>According to other texts, not the Bible, Amenadiel was the first angel to exist and the brother of Lucifer and other angels. It's believed that Amenadiel didn't know whose side to take during Lucifer's revolt to dethrone God.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ab70f49875e24dfb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the most powerful angel according to the Holy Bible?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But Legend has it that Amenadiel also had jealousy and lust for his father. This blinded him, so he secretly participated in the battle to dethrone God. He was also cast out of Heaven and became a fallen angel.</p><h2>Who was the first angel to fall?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f02be6019d06e576.jpg><p class=align-left>Lucifer was the first angel to fall from Heaven. But why was Lucifer cast out of Heaven? When God created Heaven and Earth, everything was believed to be good. This means there weren't any evil angels or demons in the angelic <a href=#>world</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Lucifer was one of the most loved angels and held Heaven's second most powerful position. Many scripts describe him as a model of perfection. His incredible beauty made him proud, i.e. his perfection was the cause of his corruption.</p><p class=align-left>Lucifer wasn't content with worshipping and being under God; he wanted the angels to worship him too. So he converted several angels to his cause and led a revolt against his father.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4ddc66b7990f01a5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Raila Odinga Wows Muslim Faithful With Knowledge on Islam: “I Can Go On and On”</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is how the once beautiful and powerful archangel lost his position in Heaven. However, when Lucifer was thrown out of Heaven, he didn't fall alone; he fell with one-third of the angels.</p><p class=align-left>The Bible doesn't have much information about the angelic world. The events around angels, including their creation, haven’t been explained clearly. This has led many to ask, "Who was the first angel that God created?" The Bible mentions some of the most powerful archangels like Gabriel, Michael and Raphael. It also mentions the archangel Lucifer, who used to be so powerful in Heaven.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke has an article about the names and <a href=#>duties of angels.</a> Angels have been mentioned several times in holy books and other traditional scripts. The Bible mentions them in both the Old and New Testaments.</p><p class=align-left>Angels live in Heaven, and they all have names and have been assigned specific duties by God. They also do anything that God instructs them, either good or bad.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a8f9598668b9d379.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of popular one-eyed characters in movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCywJyrrGWcnrOmtMCcoqxno6nCpcWObmdrcWZperi0zmaYp5%2BVoXqou8NmmqudkamypXnAnJqoqpSeu6h5waKZpZ1f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f502964-who-angel-god-created-according-bible.html&text=Who%20was%20the%20first%20angel%20that%20God%20created%20according%20to%20the%20Bible%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f502964-who-angel-god-created-according-bible.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f502964-who-angel-god-created-according-bible.html&title=Who%20was%20the%20first%20angel%20that%20God%20created%20according%20to%20the%20Bible%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f502964-who-angel-god-created-according-bible.html&title=Who%20was%20the%20first%20angel%20that%20God%20created%20according%20to%20the%20Bible%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f502964-who-angel-god-created-according-bible.html&title=Who%20was%20the%20first%20angel%20that%20God%20created%20according%20to%20the%20Bible%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f502964-who-angel-god-created-according-bible.html&description=Who%20was%20the%20first%20angel%20that%20God%20created%20according%20to%20the%20Bible%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./xstream-rock-island-grand-prix-makes-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Xstream Rock Island Grand Prix makes history">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./01-0101-20240404-5683-191-directo-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Valencia: resumen, resultado y gol">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
