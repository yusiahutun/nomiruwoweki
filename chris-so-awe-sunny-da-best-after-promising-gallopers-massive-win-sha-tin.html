I can’t tell if he’s a star, but he should be a lot of fun.</p><p>“You see the [sectional] times were really good – the second section was 22 (22.19 seconds) and the last was still 22 (22.66). Wow.”</p><p>After flashing ability at the trials, Sunny Da Best ran an encouraging third on debut to Call Me Glorious before making late ground from barrier 13 to run a handy seventh to Phoenix Light.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/20/230e5605-2a30-47eb-a852-f4ddfeccb458_7dbded0b.jpg data-fid=14963483 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1234 title="Sunny Da Best (inside) surges clear to easily account for his rivals at Sha Tin." alt="Sunny Da Best (inside) surges clear to easily account for his rivals at Sha Tin." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>With the aid of a better draw in gate six, Sunny Da Best was sent forward by De Melo but So was surprised he took up the role of pacesetter.</p><p>“I thought he might sit fifth, sixth or seventh with cover and hit the line, but he jumped well, nobody wanted to lead and we had no choice,” So said.</p><p>So expects Sunny Da Best to extend to 1,600m and possibly further, but stopped short of labelling him a Classic Series contender next season.</p><p>“I think he can step up further in distance,” So said. “I really hope he can keep improving and bring us more fun.”</p><h4>Sing the praises of Newnham’s Dragon</h4><p>Sing Dragon collected his third consecutive win at Sha Tin on Saturday and provided trainer Mark Newnham with a much-needed success after losing two of his most exciting gallopers in the past fortnight.</p><p>The lightly-raced four-year-old settled on the coattails of the leader, hit the front 200m from home and fought off a late challenge from the fast-finishing Monta Frutta in the Class Three Institute of Philanthropy Handicap (1,200m).</p><p>“I don’t think he’s one dimensional and he showed he’s got more to his armoury than just leading. He’s done a really good job,” Newnham said.</p><p>“He’s had five runs now and won three on the bounce. I don’t think he’s just an all-weather horse. Karis said he floated a little bit when he got past the horse on the inside but when the other one joined him, he stuck his head right out.</p><p>“He’ll have a break now. We’ll send him up to Conghua and probably just look at one or two races at the end of the season.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/20/66447e3f-a377-4171-8f95-559d3f704910_3478fbe9.jpg data-fid=14963484 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1131 title="Sing Dragon narrowly holds off Monta Frutta to win under Karis Teetan." alt="Sing Dragon narrowly holds off Monta Frutta to win under Karis Teetan." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>After losing Windcheater and two-time victor Show Respect in the past two weeks, Newnham says Sing Dragon’s brave triumph was particularly satisfying.</p><p>“If you’ve been in the sport as long as I have you know that’s the roller coaster of racing,” he said. “It’s unfortunate but you’ve got to bounce back from it. Plus, when you have horses like Sing Dragon it softens the blow just that little bit.”</p><p>Teetan booted home a double on Saturday after also guiding Cody Mo Wai-kit’s Celtic Times to victory in the Class Four Healthy Community Handicap (1,600m).</p><h4>Dubai Honour primed for QE II challenge</h4><p>British jockey Tom Marquand says Dubai Honour is in tip-top condition for his date with Romantic Warrior in next weekend’s Group One QE II Cup (2,000m).</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/20/de76709e-9456-4f65-8aef-34051bcf87e4_ec30b587.jpg data-fid=14963485 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1402 title="Dubai Honour on the all-weather track at Sha Tin in 2023." alt="Dubai Honour on the all-weather track at Sha Tin in 2023." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The 2022 International Jockeys Championship winner will hop aboard Dubai Honour in the HK$28 million contest and believes the Group One-winning globetrotter is poised for another battle with Danny Shum Chap-shing’s superstar.</p><p>“I’m really looking forward to riding him,” Marquand told At The Races. “I sat on him before what was going to be his trip to Australia and he felt fantastic.</p><p>“He’s proven he’s in fantastic order at Kempton. He ran massive [in Hong Kong] last year and I think he’s a horse who’s done well for all that travelling last year and it’s matured him a bit.</p><p>“He’s a very talented horse. He’s a multiple Group One winner and that’s for good reason.”</p><p>Dubai Honour has collected six wins from 19 career starts and recorded consecutive triumphs at the elite level in Australia last season.</p><p>The six-year-old warmed up for his visit to the city with a facile success over 2,000m at Kempton earlier this month. He will aim to better his third in last year’s QE II behind Romantic Warrior and Prognosis.</p><p>The William Haggas-trained gelding is set to land in Hong Kong slightly later than anticipated with the other British contingent, Believing and Brave Emperor, after their flight was delayed until Sunday morning.</p><p>The Jockey Club also announced that as a result of Television Broadcasts Limited’s (TVB) new channels arrangement, TVB Finance, Sports and Information Channel (Channel 85) will cease operation from Monday.</p><p>All racing programmes and Mark Six draws will be broadcast on Channel 82, to be renamed TVB Plus. The horse racing live programme Trackside will continue to provide Nicam services.</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6Ucm5ubF%2BYtbO10maqqGWRrLJuv9SnpbJllJZ6o7HSrWSanqSav2680aikoquZo7Rus8Clo6iolafAbrnArKqirpVixKq6jKyfmmWknrs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchris-so-awe-sunny-da-best-after-promising-gallopers-massive-win-sha-tin.html&text=Chris%20So%20in%20awe%20of%20Sunny%20Da%20Best%20after%20promising%20gallopers%20massive%20win%20at%20Sha%20Tin%20%7c%20HK%20Racing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-so-awe-sunny-da-best-after-promising-gallopers-massive-win-sha-tin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-so-awe-sunny-da-best-after-promising-gallopers-massive-win-sha-tin.html&title=Chris%20So%20in%20awe%20of%20Sunny%20Da%20Best%20after%20promising%20gallopers%20massive%20win%20at%20Sha%20Tin%20%7c%20HK%20Racing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchris-so-awe-sunny-da-best-after-promising-gallopers-massive-win-sha-tin.html&title=Chris%20So%20in%20awe%20of%20Sunny%20Da%20Best%20after%20promising%20gallopers%20massive%20win%20at%20Sha%20Tin%20%7c%20HK%20Racing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchris-so-awe-sunny-da-best-after-promising-gallopers-massive-win-sha-tin.html&title=Chris%20So%20in%20awe%20of%20Sunny%20Da%20Best%20after%20promising%20gallopers%20massive%20win%20at%20Sha%20Tin%20%7c%20HK%20Racing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-so-awe-sunny-da-best-after-promising-gallopers-massive-win-sha-tin.html&description=Chris%20So%20in%20awe%20of%20Sunny%20Da%20Best%20after%20promising%20gallopers%20massive%20win%20at%20Sha%20Tin%20%7c%20HK%20Racing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alo-yoga-sitewide-sale-spring-2023-7487468.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Katie Holmes' Go-To Activewear Brand Is Having a Sitewide Sale">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./noel-fielding-pink-and-black-smiley-jumper.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Buy Noel Fieldings wacky pink and black smiley jumper worn on Bake Off    Tue 21 September 2021">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
