Nobody ever knows when they will run into their ex. When a man sees his ex more attractive after a breakup, his feelings will depend on whether his love for his ex-partner was genuine.</p><h2>How do guys feel when they see their ex looking good?</h2><p class=align-left>When do guys start missing their ex? Most guys never miss their ex. They are always happy that the relationship ended. But other guys start missing their ex within a week or a month. A guy may start missing his ex when he sees something or goes to a place that reminds him about her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cbc6853c0e257d91.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Hot Female Millionaire Who Spent KSh 17m on Her Mansion Brags in Video: “I Can Have Any Man I Want”</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If your ex looks amazing, you will feel something inside you because you spent most of your time with that person. How do guys feel when they see their ex looking good? Below is a compiled list of different reactions from men:</p><h3>1. Regret</h3><p class=align-left>For some guys, the feeling of regret chips in when they see their ex looking good. A guy may regret it because he feels he should have held on to his ex and made the<a href=#> toxic relationship</a> work.</p><p class=align-left>Men usually compete for partners. Therefore, breaking up means they lost their partner to another person. Thus, he will become nostalgic and sentimental once he sees his ex-looking good. He will also acknowledge that he will not get back the good times he had with the girl.</p><h3>2. He may want to get back together</h3><p class=align-left>Humans are different, and one relationship is not the same as the other. After a breakup, a man may want to move on. However, he may find the new relationship unexciting as the previous one.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f6f051960aa77031.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lady, Her Fiancee Invite Only Bridesmaid, Best Man and Photographer to Their Wedding: "We Don't Want Crowd"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When he sees his ex-girlfriend looking good, the man will want to get back together with her. He wants to rekindle the relationship because he craves the comfort he had with her.</p><p class=align-left>He will want his ex-girlfriend back if he is familiar with her and misses having someone he can always count on whenever he needs support.</p><h3>3. Admiration</h3><p class=align-left>After a breakup, women usually look more beautiful to attract more men. So, when guys meet their exes for the first time after a breakup, they will admire their beauty.</p><p class=align-left>Sometimes,&nbsp;guys stalk their exes onsocial media to look at their new photos because they have not found someone as beautiful as their ex-girlfriends. Stalking on <a href=#>social media</a> proves how much he wants you back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cbc6853c0e257d91.jpg><h3>4. They may recall the past</h3><p class=align-left>How do guys feel when they see their ex looking good? Guys will have mixed memories, depending on how the relationship ended. Guys will like their ex's pictures&nbsp;online if their relationship ended on good terms.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c092ca14da586aca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does he need space or is he done? 7 simple ways to tell</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Distressing memories may emerge if the couple ends their relationship on bitter terms. Guys will recall the past because their mind is making sense of the things that no longer define their current status as they did in the past.</p><h3>5. Longing feeling</h3><p class=align-left>The feeling of longing emerges almost immediately after a breakup. Most guys begin to remember all the good things they experienced in their relationship. They regret how they treated their ex and now feel lonely with no partner to talk to.</p><p class=align-left>When they finally see their ex-girlfriend looking good, they feel longing for their ex. The guys begin to associate the good time with their presence. That even forces them to forget why their relationship ended.</p><h3>6. Jealousy</h3><p class=align-left>A guy may feel jealous for different reasons. He will feel jealous that his ex-girlfriend looks good and that someone else will have her. Also, jealousy creeps in when he sees his ex has moved on and wants her back.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/76c4bd74a2ebd903.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>8 signs your husband misses his affair partner after ending it</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He will drop hints of wanting to have more than a <a href=#>friendship</a> with his ex-partner. He will begin telling past stories or try<a href=#> rekindling memories</a>.</p><h3>7. Happy for his ex</h3><p class=align-left>Not all men become emotional after ending their relationship with their ex-partners. Most men will be happy to see their ex looking good. Such men usually have no bad feelings for their exes because they have moved on.</p><p class=align-left>They feel happy because they thought they were a stumbling block to the woman’s progress. Thus, breaking up with her was the right thing to do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f6f051960aa77031.jpg><h3>8. Guilt</h3><p class=align-left>A breakup is never easy for most guys. When their relationship ends, and they meet the girl again, the guys may start feeling guilty. The guy becomes overwhelmed with guilt because he feels like he is the one that caused the breakup.</p><p class=align-left>He feels guilty because he thinks he could have worked extra hard to save his relationship. Feeling guilty becomes intense if the guy hurts the girl despite loving her. And if the guy realises that his ex has moved on, he may feel angry at himself for messing with his relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7895d0440fb24919.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gym Instructor Says Married Women Keep Disturbing Him for Affairs: "I Was Once Offered KSh 61k"</span></p></a><h3>9. Confused</h3><p class=align-left>A guy may feel confused when he sees his ex-girlfriend looking good. Initially, the guy thought his girlfriend was not working hard enough to look good for him. Therefore, he decided to end the relationship and look for someone better.</p><p class=align-left>Suddenly, he sees his ex-girlfriend looking good, and many questions emerge. He wonders whether the girl ever loved him or was uncomfortable with him. But confusion also arises when the man is undecided on whether to rekindle the <a href=#>romantic relationship</a> or let it die.</p><h3>10. Lack of confidence</h3><p class=align-left>When a relationship ends, some guys may start questioning their self-esteem. That happens when the girl ends the relationship and not the man. The guy will lack self-confidence, especially if he cannot find someone else to replace her. He feels rejected and blames himself for what went wrong.</p><p class=align-left>So,&nbsp;how do guys feel when they see their ex looking good? The man may be happy for their ex-girlfriend and wish them all the best. Also, they may feel jealous, especially if the woman ends the relationship. In other cases, the man may not feel anything for their ex-girlfriend if the relationship ended badly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b1552faddeaeb3d2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Man Working as Electrician in US Says He Has No Regrets: "Best Decision&nbsp;Ever&nbsp;Made"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about <a href=#>different types of girls </a>you'll meet and their personalities.
