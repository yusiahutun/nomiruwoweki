That being said, his business ventures, including his dedication to his soccer team, are showing no signs of stopping, so read on to learn more about his net worth and career as a major <a href=#>celebrity</a> A-Lister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-1482300231-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-ryan-reynolds-age-and-family-background>Who is Ryan Reynolds? Age and family background</h2><p><strong>Full name</strong>: Ryan Rodney Reynolds</p><p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Vancouver, Canada</p><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Married to <a href=#>Blake Lively</a></p><p><strong>Birthday</strong>: October 23, 1976</p><p>Born to James Chester Reynolds and Tamara Lee in Canada, Ryan is the youngest of four sons. His brothers are called Jeff, Patrick, and Terry.</p><p>His father was a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman before becoming a food wholesaler, and Tamara worked in retail sales. Reynolds’ grandfather, Chester, was a Canadian provincial politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly Of Alberty in the 1940s. The family has Scottish and Irish ancestry.</p><p>While two of his siblings went on to work in law enforcement, Ryan opted to pursue acting after graduation from Kitsilano Secondary School. He attended Kwantlen Polytechnic University but dropped out after a few months to move to Los Angeles at age 19.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Movie star Ryan Reynolds earned his break as a teen soap actor</h2><p>Ryan’s career didn’t start out with him portraying a hero. His break came in 1990 starring as Billy Simpson in the Canadian teen soap opera, Hillside, which aired in the US as Fifteen on Nickelodeon. Yes, he is technically a Nick kid.</p><p>After several <a href=#>TV</a> roles, he landed roles alongside the likes of Michael Douglas (The In-Laws) and Ray Liotta (Smokin’ Aces). His first superhero film, Blade: Trinity, came in 2004, followed by X-Men Origins: Wolverine five years later.</p><p>Reynolds officially became a leading actor in a hero film as Green Lantern and although it failed commercially and critically, it was the start of his romance with his wife, <a href=#>Blake Lively</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inside his relationship with Blake Lively and their three kids</h2><p><a href=#>Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively</a> met in early 2010 on the set of Green Lantern. During that time, Ryan was still married to fellow Marvel star Scarlett Johansson; they filed for divorce in December 2010, which was finalized seven months later.</p><p>Blake and Ryan began dating in October 2011 and tied the knot in September 2012.</p><p>The pair isn’t afraid to share PDA online, but it’s not the classic romance you’d expect. Ryan and Blake are known to savagely troll each other on social media, including that one time the actress posted a birthday tribute to her husband, but uploaded a photo of Ryan Gosling instead.</p><p>11 years of marriage later, <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively share four children</a>: daughters James, Inez, and Betty. Blake discreetly gave birth to their fourth child in early 2023 but the name and gender are not publically known yet.</p><p>Ryan dated singer Alanis Morissette from 2002 to 2007 before his three-year marriage to Johansson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-1395106844-849x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ryan Reynolds’ net worth is over 10 times more than Blake Lively’s</h2><p>Although they’re a power couple, their net worths are far from equal. Ryan has an estimated fortune of $350 million while Blake’s net worth is 10 times less at $30 million.</p><p>The actor has business ventures in the media and alcohol industry and telecommunication services. He launched his production company, Maximum Effort in 2018, which has created adverts for Deadpool 2, Free Guy, and The Adam Project. The company was acquired by MNTN, an advertising software company, making Reynolds the brand’s chief creative officer.</p><p>Both Blake and Ryan are in the beverage industry, but the latter hopped onto the bandwagon three years before Lively released non-alcoholic mixers known as Betty Buzz. The Deadpool actor acquired a stake in Aviation American Gin in 2018 and two years later, he sealed a deal with spirits giant Diageo in a sale worth about $610 million. Combined with his title as the second highest-paid actor of 2020 at $71.5 million, his net worth is hardly surprising.</p><p>A phone operator was the last project we’d associate with a <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor, but Ryan owned between 20 to 25 per cent of Mint Mobile. T-Mobile acquired it in a deal worth up to $1.35 billion. He remains at Mint in a creative role, but his stake ownership is unknown.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reynolds has transformed Wrexham AFC with Rob McElhenney</h2><p>If you’ve been wondering where Reynolds has been while off the screen, take a visit to Wrexham AFC, the Welsh football club which Ryan and actor Rob McElhenney took over in 2020. The Free Guy star and It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia actor invested $2.25 million to grow the team’s popularity and success.</p><p>The local community was skeptical that the showbiz stars could boost the team, but the duo managed to build rapport with fans quickly. In April 2023, Wrexgan won the Vanaram National League, securing promotion back to the English Football League (EFL) after a 15-year absence.</p><p>The club has also gained global attention after the release of their FX docuseries, Welcome To Wrexham, as told by Reynolds and McElhenney.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ryan Reynolds discovered a growth during his colonoscopy</h2><p>There is no such thing as TMI for the actor, who documented his colonoscopy experience to raise awareness about colon cancer. “I would never normally have any medical procedure put on camera. It’s not every day where you can raise awareness on something that will most definitely save lives,” he said.</p><p>Doctors found an “extremely subtle polyp” on the right of Ryan’s colon, which was removed during the examination. A colon polyp is a growth of tissue that has the potential to turn into cancer over time.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2aAcL7YmqVmqpWuu7C4w6xkmqaUYq%2BtrcqeZKWhppq5unnAq5xmmV2lvLix0WaaqK2gobJurtStZKGho2K7psCMsKarrJhitrR5zq%2Bcq2VhZcVuuc6rnGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-are-a-power-couple-but-his-net-worth-is-over-10x-more.html&text=Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Blake%20Lively%20are%20a%20power%20couple%20but%20his%20net%20worth%20is%20over%2010x%20more&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-are-a-power-couple-but-his-net-worth-is-over-10x-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-are-a-power-couple-but-his-net-worth-is-over-10x-more.html&title=Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Blake%20Lively%20are%20a%20power%20couple%20but%20his%20net%20worth%20is%20over%2010x%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-are-a-power-couple-but-his-net-worth-is-over-10x-more.html&title=Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Blake%20Lively%20are%20a%20power%20couple%20but%20his%20net%20worth%20is%20over%2010x%20more" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-are-a-power-couple-but-his-net-worth-is-over-10x-more.html&title=Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Blake%20Lively%20are%20a%20power%20couple%20but%20his%20net%20worth%20is%20over%2010x%20more" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-are-a-power-couple-but-his-net-worth-is-over-10x-more.html&description=Ryan%20Reynolds%20and%20Blake%20Lively%20are%20a%20power%20couple%20but%20his%20net%20worth%20is%20over%2010x%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./519454-sophia-diggs-ghostface-killahs-relationship-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sophia Diggs and Ghostface Killah's relationship and children">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./662559a7268e3e80208b4588-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Resumen Feyenoord vs NEC: Santi Gimnez brinda asistencia para el gol de Igor Paixo y coronarse e">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
