He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft and after a 4 season stays on the team he joined the Atlanta Falcons in 2016.</p><h2><strong>Mohamed Sanu Bio (Age)</strong></h2><p>Mohamed Sanu Sr. was born on August 22, 1989, the son of Aminata Koroma and Samuel Sanu. His parents originally came from the West African country Sierra Leone, where he spent several years of his childhood. At the age of 6, he finally returned to the USA with his older sister Jabbie, and they grew up in Dayton, New Jersey. His father was also a professional athlete who played for the Sierra Leone national soccer team in his youth.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Monica Bellucci Bio, Children, Husband, Net Worth, Acting & Modelling Career</a></strong></p><p>Mohamed Sanu went to school at South Brunswick High School, where he was a letterman in both football and athletics. As a quarterback with three options, Sanu led the school’s team into the playoffs for the first time in nearly four decades. Because Mohamed Sanu had passed the NJSIAA age limit, he was not qualified to play in his senior year and therefore graduated from high school 6 months early.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mohamed-Sanu.jpg><p>In January 2009, Sanu enrolled at Rutgers University, where he became the first player in Rutgers University history to start as a rookie wide receiver. As a wildcat quarterback, the talented player caught 51 passes over 639 yards with 3 touchdowns, 62 stormy tries over 346 yards, and 5 stormy touchdowns. He was also named MVP at the 2009 St. Petersburg Bowl, where Rutgers outdid the UCF Knights. Sanu was also unanimously voted 2010 All-Big East Wide Receiver of the preseason.</p><p>In his 3-season presence with the Rutgers Scarlet Knights soccer team, where he played 38 games, Mohamed Sanu had 210 receptions for 2,263 yards and 19 touchdowns with net yardage of 3,019, as well as 8 of 18 passes for 207 yards and 4 touchdowns. After his junior season, Sanu went on to the 2012 NFL Draft, where he finished the third round of the season in 83rd place from the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><h2><strong>Mohamed Sanu </strong><strong>NFL Career</strong></h2><p>Mohamed Sanu made his NFL debut on September 23, 2012, in the Bengal game against the Washington Redskins. He came into the game as a wildcat quarterback and scored the first touchdown pass of his professional career against A. J. Green. This made him the first wide receiver to ever throw a touchdown pass in the history of the Cincinnati Bengals. He continued this record-breaking form in the following weeks until his rookie season ended due to a foot injury.</p><p>Mohamed Sanu returned in the 2013 season. He played in all 16 Bengal games and finished the season with 47 receptions, 455 yards, and two touchdowns. Due to injury misfortune of teammates A. J. Green and Marvin Jones, Sanu played a bigger role in the 2014 season of the Bengals. With 56 receptions over 790 yards and 5 touchdowns, he improved his performance last season. In his last season (2015) with the Cincinnati Bengals, the talented player caught 33 passes over 394 yards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mohamed-Sanu-Career.jpg><p>Mohamed Sanu joined the Atlanta Falcons in March 2016 under a five-year contract worth $32.5 million. In his first season (2016) with the Falcons, he had 59 receptions for 653 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Falcons won the NFC South title and also made it to the Super Bowl LI where they were overwhelmed by the New England Patriots. In the 2017 season, Sanu had 67 receptions for 703 yards and 5 touchdowns when the Falcons entered the playoffs with a 10-6 record.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sonequa Martin-Green Bio, Husband – Kenric Green, Height, Age, Baby</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Wife or Girlfriend, Is He Married?</strong></h2><p>Marriage may play a role in Mohamed Sanu’s plans for the near future, but this big step is yet to come. With his engagement to his then-girlfriend Lauren Mackenzie in February 2016, the NFL star was very close to untying the knot. The proposal was quite memorable, as it took place at London’s Wembley Stadium during a match between the English Premier League teams Liverpool and Manchester City.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mohamed-Sanu-and-Dani-Lee..jpg><p>Before their engagement, the duo had a child together. Their son Mohamed Sanu Jr. was born on August 21, 2015, the day before Sanu turned 25.</p><p>However, Mohamed Sanu Sr. eventually did not marry his former fiancée Lauren Mackenzie. Sometime in early 2018, the star of the Atlanta Falcons met with Dani Lee, a fashion entrepreneur.</p><h2><strong>Height, Weight, and Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Mohamed Sanu Sr. is 188 cm (6 feet 2 inches) tall and has a weight of 98 kg (215 lb). Further details of his body measurements have yet to be confirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kurC0wKacnWWjlru2edainZ5ll56%2FrbLRopynnF2dsqqzx61ksJ2ZnLW1ecyemKytopq6prrTrGSboZ9k</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmohamed-sanu-wife-girlfriend-height-weight-measurements-bio.html&text=Mohamed%20Sanu%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements%2c%20Bio&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmohamed-sanu-wife-girlfriend-height-weight-measurements-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmohamed-sanu-wife-girlfriend-height-weight-measurements-bio.html&title=Mohamed%20Sanu%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmohamed-sanu-wife-girlfriend-height-weight-measurements-bio.html&title=Mohamed%20Sanu%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmohamed-sanu-wife-girlfriend-height-weight-measurements-bio.html&title=Mohamed%20Sanu%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmohamed-sanu-wife-girlfriend-height-weight-measurements-bio.html&description=Mohamed%20Sanu%20Wife%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements%2c%20Bio" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./black-music-honors-announces-honorees-missy-elliott-swv-evelyn-champagne-king-jeffrey-osborne-the-hawkins-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Black Music Honors Announces Honorees Missy Elliott, SWV, Evelyn Champagne King, Jeffrey Osbor">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./laura-g.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Laura G Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
