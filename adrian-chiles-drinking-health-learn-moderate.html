Less has turned out to be more.</p><p>In my new book, I share my easy steps on how to cut down without cutting out.</p><p>And below is my advice for becoming a good drinker.</p><ul><li><strong>The Good Drinker, How I Learned To Love Drinking Less, by Adrian Chiles, is out now.</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0jpg-JS769726063.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>MY THREE-MILE LINE OF DRINKS</h2><p>DRINKING has been the focus of my social life since my mid-teens.</p><p>If all the drinks I’ve put away in my life were laid out in a line, it would stretch for about three miles.</p><p>But how many of those did I really enjoy, want or need?</p><p>If I walk along my three-mile line of drinks I’m appalled to realise that by the one-mile mark I’m seeing drinks I could have done without — drinks I could have not drunk without diminishing my enjoyment of anything.</p><p>Let’s put a figure on my proportion of “essential” drinking.</p><p>I’ve got it at 30 per cent. So, 70 per cent of what I’ve glugged has been for nothing. Two miles of drinks for nothing. What an idiot.</p><p>Not only have I gained nothing by squirting that lot through my system, I have to consider the downsides — the money, the calories and the detrimental effect on my physical and <a href=#>mental health</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I resolved to find a way of ­living my drinking life in the beautiful 30 per cent of the drinks I want and leaving the pointless 70 per cent behind.</p><p>I always want to be able to take a quiet early evening pint or two with a friend; share a bottle of wine over dinner somewhere; and, yes, occasionally drink too much at a <a href=#>wedding</a>, say something inappropriate to a relative of the bride, and dance with wild incompetence.</p><p>This is the greatest motivation for cutting down.</p><p>I never want to get to the stage where doctors are telling me I mustn’t touch another drop.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">THE HEALTH BIT</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>HERE’S what it boils down to: If you habitually drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week, you’re likely to be harming yourself.</p><p>If you are drinking only slightly more than 14 <a href=#>units</a>, the risk of harm is only slightly elevated. If you’re drinking twice as much, you double your risk.</p><p>But, to put a more positive spin on that, if you reduce your weekly intake from 60 units to 30, you are more than halving the risk of harm.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>THE LEE MACK RULE OF TWO</h2><p>WANT a single tip I’d recommend?</p><p>It’s this one from my friend, the comedian <a href=#>Lee Mack</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Lee’s parents were publicans. Both died in their fifties as a result of their alcohol intake.</p><p>His brother also had serious alcohol issues.</p><p>Lee decided to cut down on his drinking a lot, but then decided to stop all together as he was persuaded that the whole thing was, essentially, a con.</p><p>Interestingly, it wasn’t complete abstinence that led Lee to his conclusions, it was his early attempts at moderation.</p><p>This is what he said: “When I first thought about cutting down or stopping boozing, I made a deal with myself that I would start every night with two drinks that were ice-cold and no-alcohol, usually zero- alcohol lager.</p><p>“After them I could have whatever alcoholic drinks I liked, with no limit.</p><p>“I found that by the time I’d finished those two drinks, I was just not as interested in booze as I was at the start of the evening.</p><p>“Why would I be when, without it, I was still relaxed, refreshed and having a laugh?</p><p>“Also, two pints of any ­liquid is enough. It’s only the addictive element that makes you want more.”</p><p>It’s worked so well for me that I’ve given it a name — the Lee Mack Rule Of Two. The expression is To Do A Mack.</p><p>I hope that the words, “Oh, an <a href=#>alcohol-free</a> please — I’m Doing A Mack” will be heard in pubs across the UK.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>COUNT THE BLOODY THINGS</h2><p>IF there’s one reason I’ve managed to cut down on my drinking, it is because I know how much I’m drinking. I count, and keep a record of what I’ve drunk.</p><p>It is boring but if you want to drink less, you must do it.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know:</p><ul><li>A unit of alcohol is 10ml or 8g of pure alcohol: a single 25ml shot of spirits or a very small glass of wine.&nbsp;</li><li>A pint of beer tends to be a bit more than two units.</li></ul><p>There are apps to help you keep track of your units. My favourite is Drink Less, as it is simple to use.</p><p>There are patchy areas in my data and this is when I’ve slipped into drinking too much and stopped keeping track.</p><p>This is a warning signal. It doesn’t mean I’ve failed — it means I’ve slipped up and I resolve to tidy things up.&nbsp;</p><p>But I couldn’t wrest back control like this if I hadn’t been keeping tabs on my intake in the first place.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ASK WHY YOU ARE HAVING THAT DRINK</h2><p>I’VE had no trouble at all remembering the good times I’ve had while drinking.</p><p>And the few really bad episodes, featuring vomiting and assorted blunders, do stick in the mind because they are shocking.</p><p>But more shocking is the revelation that most of the drinking I’ve done is entirely forgettable. &nbsp;</p><p>A professional <a href=#>gambler</a> once told me: “Being a successful gambler is less about the bets you make than the bets you don’t make.</p><p>“Keeping your money in your pocket is the hardest thing to do, when you’re thinking you might as well.”</p><p>The same applies to drinking — being a good drinker is about the alcohol you choose not to drink.&nbsp;</p><p>“Might as well” was a good-enough reason for me to have a drink.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>Now I ask myself if I want this drink, if I need it and, importantly, if I’ll enjoy it. If two of those three apply, I’ll have it.</p><p>If it’s a case of “might as well”, I won’t.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzfJBxb2tuaGSupb7ImqVmm5ieuaa%2FjJ2poqabnruoeceemKWsmGK5pq3Rp2Smp5Sav6LAxGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fadrian-chiles-drinking-health-learn-moderate.html&text=I%20drank%20100%20units%20a%20week%20and%20it%20was%20ruining%20my%20health%20-%20but%20I%20learnt%20to%20moderate%20and%20here%27s%20how%20you%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadrian-chiles-drinking-health-learn-moderate.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadrian-chiles-drinking-health-learn-moderate.html&title=I%20drank%20100%20units%20a%20week%20and%20it%20was%20ruining%20my%20health%20-%20but%20I%20learnt%20to%20moderate%20and%20here%27s%20how%20you%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fadrian-chiles-drinking-health-learn-moderate.html&title=I%20drank%20100%20units%20a%20week%20and%20it%20was%20ruining%20my%20health%20-%20but%20I%20learnt%20to%20moderate%20and%20here%27s%20how%20you%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fadrian-chiles-drinking-health-learn-moderate.html&title=I%20drank%20100%20units%20a%20week%20and%20it%20was%20ruining%20my%20health%20-%20but%20I%20learnt%20to%20moderate%20and%20here%27s%20how%20you%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadrian-chiles-drinking-health-learn-moderate.html&description=I%20drank%20100%20units%20a%20week%20and%20it%20was%20ruining%20my%20health%20-%20but%20I%20learnt%20to%20moderate%20and%20here%27s%20how%20you%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./spas-salons.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The best spa hotels in Europe, from Italy to France and more">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nsfwyoutube-watch-flagged-youtube-videos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Watch Flagged YouTube Videos Without Logging In">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
