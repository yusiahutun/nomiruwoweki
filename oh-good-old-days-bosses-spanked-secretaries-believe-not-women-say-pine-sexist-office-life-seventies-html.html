Yet, astonishingly, many of the women featured in the programme claim that it was the best time ever to be a woman at work, and that the perks accorded to good-looking secretaries — being offered the boss’s Rolls-Royce and chauffeur to take you shopping for the afternoon, or wined and dined in the best restaurants — far outweighed any downsides.</span></p><img id=i-4964d00b605c8e29 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/03/2386F50800000578-0-image-m-35_1417646752044.jpg height=830 width=634 alt="Jacquee's experiences were in the early Seventies, when bottom-pinching, drunken lunches and open office affairs were rife in the workplace" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Jacquee's experiences were in the early Seventies, when bottom-pinching, drunken lunches and open office affairs were rife in the workplace</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Nor was it just women who took full advantage of the somewhat louche attitudes that prevailed in British offices in the Seventies.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Former public relations executive and advertising guru Lord Bell, 73 — the man behind Margaret Thatcher’s famous ‘Labour Isn’t Working’ 1979 election campaign — admits that female employees were then regarded more as sex objects than equals.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Good-looking secretaries were a status symbol among managers, with men competing to hire the most attractive woman possible.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>One of his superiors even persuaded a prospective secretary who had come in for interview to take her top and bra off so he could check her assets.</span></p><img id=i-d42065e997f2526a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/03/23848CA000000578-0-image-a-36_1417646798088.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Jaquee, now in her 50s, remembers that it was certainly a struggle to be taken seriously as a woman in the workplace" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Jaquee, now in her 50s, remembers that it was certainly a struggle to be taken seriously as a woman in the workplace</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘He was convinced he should only employ someone with very large breasts, and he said to her suddenly in the conversation “can I have a look?” — and amazingly she said yes,’ he recalls.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Not content with that, he called in the rest of his colleagues — including the then Tim Bell — to partake of the view.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘She didn’t mind in the slightest,’ he insists. ‘It’s a disgusting story that would now be considered unacceptable, but at the time it was considered funny.

If I complained they would say “typical woman, she can’t take a joke”.’</span></p><img id=i-ebf4cf642b3c5c72 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/03/2386D7E000000578-0-image-a-37_1417646866768.jpg height=492 width=634 alt="Raised in Dagenham, Jacquee embarked on general office work in her teens before landing a job as a secretary at a large multinational company" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Raised in Dagenham, Jacquee embarked on general office work in her teens before landing a job as a secretary at a large multinational company</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Raised in Dagenham, Jacquee embarked on general office work in her teens before landing a job as a secretary at a large multinational company, where she remained for almost two decades, rising to the role of assistant manager.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In her first department, she was the only woman among nine men, and as such was routinely belittled.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I remember being in a meeting and offering an opinion and someone said “Who cares what you think, you’re just a woman?” That attitude was pretty common,’ she says.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I’d often hear men saying: “I’ve never met a female manager who is any good” — to which I would reply that I knew an awful lot of male managers who weren’t any good either.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>If such put-downs didn’t work, Jacquee occasionally resorted to surreptitious violence to get her own back on sexist men.

We had lots of celebrations where we would go for drinks for someone’s birthday and be out for hours and only return to the office to get our coats to go home. You certainly never heard about anyone complaining of stress.’</span></p><img id=i-9910a94bf69d615b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/03/2386D4E500000578-0-Jacquee_did_take_maternity_leave_to_have_children_but_returned_t-a-43_1417647078492.jpg height=486 width=306 alt="Jacquee did take maternity leave to have children but returned to work shortly afterwards, continuing until she was made redundant in the late Nineties" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Jacquee did take maternity leave to have children but returned to work shortly afterwards, continuing until she was made redundant in the late Nineties</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Nor did Judi Grossman, now 63, who spent the Seventies enjoying what she recalls as a carefree time in which long lunches and shopping were all part of a day’s work.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Raised on a farm in Essex, she went to secretarial college in London before spending the next five years temping, before giving up work in 1975 to raise her twin daughters, Kara and Vanessa, now 39.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘There was work to be done, but not a lot of it,’ she says. ‘At quite a few of the places I worked if I told my boss I had a party in the evening he would say: “OK, go at 2pm.” ’ One even used to let me use his Rolls-Royce and driver to go shopping in the West End for the afternoon.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It helped, of course, if you happened to be attractive — as Judi, then a bubbly brunette, undoubtedly was. ‘Looks did play a part,’ she admits. ‘If your boss liked you, you got away with murder — it was as simple as that. There was always a coterie of men who were happy to take you out to lunch.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Some would, on occasion, attempt to take things further.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I remember being chased around a boardroom at a drinks party by a university lecturer I was working for at the time — but back then you just dealt with it. I just said “oh grow up” to him. It wasn’t a big deal.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She admits that there were occasions when such high-jinks got a little out of control — like the time one of her senior managers stuck his hand up her skirt while she was taking a phone call.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I felt like clocking him but all I could do was glare at him. I certainly didn’t stop the call,’ she says. ‘It was outrageous, really. When I put the phone down I said: “Don’t you ever do that again.” And he didn’t — but he didn’t apologise either.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Judi’s secretarial career ended after five years when she married and fell pregnant, although she returned to it for a few years in the mid-Eighties, taking up a role at a legal firm.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘Things had changed markedly even in the space of a decade,’ she recalls. ‘It was already more serious, more stressful. In the end I left again. To be honest I never took work terribly seriously.’</span></p><img id=i-327720a9c61a7222 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/03/23848CAB00000578-0-image-a-41_1417647002069.jpg height=402 width=634 alt="Judi Grossman, now 63, spent the Seventies enjoying what she recalls as a carefree time in which long lunches and shopping were all part of a day’s work" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Judi Grossman, now 63, spent the Seventies enjoying what she recalls as a carefree time in which long lunches and shopping were all part of a day’s work</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Of course not all women starting out as secretaries in the Seventies were happy with the status quo.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Ros Altmann, now 58 and one of the country’s leading independent pensions advisers, as well as a Government Business Champion for older workers, first undertook secretarial work as a teenager.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She used the money she earned working for a large advertising agency, a law firm, a consultancy and estate agency to pay her way through university.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘By and large I enjoyed it, but it also opened my eyes to the reality of life in the work-place,’ she says. ‘As a woman you were pretty much a second-class citizen, while the secretaries were almost seen as playthings. The men would have jokes about them in earshot — “Check out her boobs”, that sort of thing. And you were just expected to take it.
