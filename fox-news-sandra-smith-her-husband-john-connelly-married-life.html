The couple found love at their workplace and ended up tying the wedding knot.</p><p>The host of the Fox Network show Outnumbered,&nbsp;Sadra is on cloud 9 regarding her family life. However, there was news surrounding the pair’s split in online tabloids. What’s the truth? Well, we just have the right information, follow the article below to grab all the details.</p><h2>Sandra Going Out On A Date With John Connelly</h2><p>The Fox News reporter started working as a sales trader in the same network as her future better half. At that time, Smith had just completed her education and took the position vacated by John Connelly. Both are from Chicago and at the station, the couple noticed each other.</p><p>John and Sandra ignited their love affair in a romantic fashion. John at first did not pay any attention to Sandra but with his corner eye, he was blushing to look at her. Surely, love was in the air for him and before leaving the station he found the courage to ask her out.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ctk9zksxaaewqch-FILEminimizer.jpg alt width=477 height=358 data-sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sandra agreed to his proposal and the romantic affair continued with one after another date and soon they became a loving couple.</p><h2>When Did Sandra Smith And John Connelly Tie The Knot?</h2><p>John and Sandra’s love life had to go through the test of a long-distance relationship. Sandra joined Bloomberg Television in New York and she was 789 miles away from her love. Connelly at the time was establishing his business in Chicago.</p><p>The pair had to satisfy their thirst for meeting each other on Skype and phone calls. In most relationships, the affair takes a toll because of not having an intimate event nevertheless, Sandra and John went through this test with big smiles on their faces.</p><p>As the duo thought this will last temporarily but Sandra had to settle in New York when she <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">joined Fox News.</a> The distance between the lovebirds did not matter for both of them as they turned their relationship from a boyfriend and girlfriend to a husband and wife by exchanging wedding vows on 1st May 2010.</p><h2>How Is Sandra Smith’s Married Life And Family Going On? Their Children?</h2><p>Going through all the barriers and tying the knot in 2010, their wedding was quite extravagant. Smith and John confessed their love and the promise to live with each other forever in front of their family and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fox-news-s-sandra-smith-s-family-life-is-a-bliss-with-husband-john-connelly-and-her-baby-boy.jpg><p>The wedding took place at Holy Name Cathedral in the couple’s hometown, Chicago. Even after the marriage, their love was tested yet again when the pair had to stay apart from each other for a year. In 2011, John made some arrangements and traveled to New York to settle with his wife.</p><p>As of now, John is working at CME group as Director of product marketing, and in 2013, the couple became the proud parent of a daughter, <strong>Cora Belle Connelly</strong>.
