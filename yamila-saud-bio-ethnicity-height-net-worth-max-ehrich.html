And guess who she’s dating? Demi Lovato’s ex-fiancé, Max Ehrich!</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Yamila Saud Bio to learn more about her.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Yamila Saud, Max Ehrich’s Girlfriend</b></h3><p><span>It was Feb 24, 2022, when Yamila Saud and Max Ehrich first made their public appearance together at the premiere of the Hulu series, </span><i><span>The Dropout</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>“He (Max) was super excited to have her at the premiere for the first time,” a source shared at the time. Also, the insider reported that the duo met through mutual friends and was dating for a month then. So their relationship was “very new.”</span></p><p><span>A day later, Yamila then took it to her IG to share a picture from the event — where she was captured kissing her beau on the cheek.</span></p><p><span>The news about Yamila and Max’s relationship comes after almost a year and a half of Max’s split with Demi Lovato. But Yamila wasn’t the first lady Max was linked with, after the breakup. In less than a month after Demi called off their engagement, Max was spotted with former </span><i><span>American Idol</span></i><span> contestant Sonika Vaid.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, as per the insider, Max’s relationship with Sonika was was “all smoke and mirrors.” The actor just wanted to make it look like he was moving on with another woman. Reportedly, Sonika was in a full relationship and lived with her boyfriend soon after.</span></p><p><span>“I met Max recently at dinner with mutual friends. It was a fun night and we all got to hang out and head to the studio together,” Sonika spoke about her time with Max.</span></p><p><span>After Max’s split with Demi, the iCarly actor also allegedly left thirsty messages on posts from Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and Miley Cyrus. So, as fans started to label him as a clout chaser, Max alleged posted a video saying, “Yes, I have a giant crush on Selena Gomez. It’s true, yes.”</span></p><p><span>However, Demi slammed the screenshots as “doctored” and “fake.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Nile Niami And Yamila Saud: Wedding, Divorce</b></h3><p><span>Like Max, Yamila Saud also allegedly has had a failed relationship. She was reportedly married to the American film producer and real estate developer Nile Niami until mid-2021.</span></p><p><span>Before marrying Yamila, Nile was in an 18-year-long relationship with his ex-wife </span><a href=#><span>Yvonne Niami</span></a><span>, the philanthropist. The two filed for divorce in Jan 2017, which cost the mega-mansion builder a few hundred thousand of his total net worth.</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, Nile’s net worth was over $500 thousand.</span></p><p><span>Talking a little more about Yamila’s ex-husband, Nile started his career as a film producer and transitioned into the real estate development world. Today, the guy develops extremely lavish mansions in the LA area that could cost $100 million and above.</span></p><p><span>So, why is his net worth comparable low? Well, most of his asset was tied up in a mansion called </span><i><span>The One</span></i><span>,</span> <span>which was the subject of many lawsuits and around $165 million worth of loans.</span></p><h3><b>Yamila Saud Ethnicity</b></h3><p><span>Yamila Saud hails from Cordoba, Argentina. So, she flaunts Argentinian/Latina ethnicity.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, her boyfriend Max Ehrich was born and raised in Marlboro, NJ, in a Jewish family.</span></p><h3><b>Yamila Saud Height</b></h3><p><span>Yamila Saud stands tall at a height under 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm). She is a little shorter than Max who is 5 feet 7 inches (171 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning her distinct features, she has hazel eyes, naturally dark hair (that she likes to color blond), and a triangular face.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Yamila Saud Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Yamila Saud garnered a net worth of under $300 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span>An aspiring actress since young, Yamila has been performing on stage since she was seven years old. So, to further enhance her talent, Yamila studied at the famous </span><i><span>Academy of Carlos Gandolfo</span></i><span>, alongside Dora Baret and Matias Gandolfo, and it helped her kick-start her career in TV and film production.</span></p><p><span>Later, she then went on to graduate from the </span><i><span>New York Film Academy</span></i><span> (NYFA) — one of the premier visual and performing arts colleges in the world.</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, she has appeared in movies and TV shows including </span><i><span>An American Masquerade </span></i><span>(2022), </span><i><span>El Encanto</span></i><span> (2020), </span><i><span>Solo el Amor </span></i><span>(2018), </span><i><span>Hypersomnia </span></i><span>(2016), </span><i><span>Farsantes</span></i><span> (2013), and</span><i><span> Condicionados </span></i><span>(2012).</span></p><p><span>Besides acting, Yamila has also stepped into the industry as a producer in </span><i><span>Solo el Amor </span></i><span>(2018),</span><i><span> Recreo</span></i><span> (2018), and</span><i><span> Hypersomnia</span></i><span> (2016). However, the actress had no plans to be a producer. “When I started to produce I didn’t know it all, but it just happened naturally,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Talking about her accolades, Yamila won the “Best Actress in Peru” at the “Insólito”, the </span><i><span>Terror and Fantasy Film Festival</span></i><span> in Lima. Also, She was selected for a special screening at the</span><i><span> Blood Window Galas</span></i><span> at the 2017 </span><i><span>Cannes Film Festival</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> Yamila’s idols in the industry are&nbsp; Salma Hayek, Ricardo Darin and&nbsp; Alfonso Cuarón.
