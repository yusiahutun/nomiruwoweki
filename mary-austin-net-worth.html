Despite the fact that her name is unknown to many music fans, she was a major influence in the late rock star’s personal and professional life.</strong></p><h2><span id=Early_Life_of_Mary_Austin>Early Life of Mary Austin</span></h2><p>Mary Austin was born in Fulham, London, United Kingdom, on March 6, 1951. Her parents were deaf, and she came from a working-class family. Her father worked as a wallpaper trimmer, and her mother worked as a domestic for a local firm.</p><p>She had to work extremely hard to make ends meet in this economic climate. At the age of 15, Mary had to drop out of school and work as a receptionist. This move was made to help her parents, who were going through a difficult time. She then moved on to Biba, a more fashionable establishment where she catered to a number of celebrities.</p><p>Brian May was introduced to her while she was working with Biba. They clicked and began dating for a while. However, things did not work out, and they mutually ended their relationship.</p><p>Mary had two children with her first husband, whom she married in 1990. Richard and Jamie are the names of these children. However, in 1993, they divorced. In 1998, she married Nicholas Holford, but the marriage was annulled in 2002.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life_of_Mary_Austin_with_Freddie_Mercury>Personal Life of Mary Austin with Freddie Mercury</span></h2><p>It’s impossible to discuss Mary without mentioning Freddie Mercury. When Mary was working at a West London boutique in 1969, they met. Their love grew quickly, and they eventually shared a flat in Kensington Market.</p><p>In 1973, Freddie proposed to Mary. He could barely conceal his sexuality, so he began having affairs with men. Freddie didn’t tell her about his bisexuality until 1976. Austin, on the other hand, thought Mercury was gay, not bisexual. Although their relationship ended, they remained close friends.</p><p>In September 1991, Freddie signed his will, leaving Mary a sizable inheritance. She was also the one who was in charge of keeping and scattering his ashes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biogossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/freddie-mercury-1946-1991-of-queen-attends-fashion-aid-at-the-royal-albert-hall-in-london-with-his-friend-mary-austin-5th-november-1985-photo-by-dave-hogangetty-images-1.jpg><h2><span id=What_is_Freddie_Mercury8217s_Death_Cause>What is Freddie Mercury’s Death Cause?</span></h2><p>On November 24, 1991, Freddie died, and his funeral was held three days later. Mary asked Peter, Jim, and Freddie’s ex-boyfriend Joe Fanelli to leave One Garden Lodge three months later.</p><p>This sparked some controversy, with some seeing it as a betrayal of Freddie’s memory. Peter spoke to The Express once more to clarify a complicated and inflammatory story.</p><p>Freddie said that:</p><p>“As you all know in his will he left Garden Lodge and all its contents to Mary Austin. This did not include three adult males.</p><p>“So that Freddie’s written will could go through probate it was necessary that we were no longer in the house and we were all given three months to make our arrangements.</p><p>“We were not evicted onto the streets, as Freddie had made sure we all had somewhere to go.”</p><p>To get started, Freddie gave each of the three men <strong>£500,000</strong>, which was a much larger sum in 1991.</p><h2><span id=What_is_Mary_Austin_Net_Worth>What is Mary Austin Net Worth?</span></h2><p>Mary is best known for being Freddie Mercury’s ex-girlfriend. Austin was introduced to Queen guitarist Brian May, and the two began dating.

Mary Austin was born in the year 1951 in Fulham, London, England.</p><h2><span id=Mercury_was_gay_not_bisexual-Austin_Believed>Mercury was gay, not bisexual-Austin Believed</span></h2><p>Things were not going so well at home. Marriage was no longer discussed six years into their relationship, and Austin began to suspect something was wrong. She decided to speak with Mercury about the situation.</p><p>“I told him, ‘Something is going on and I just feel like a noose around your neck. I think it’s time for me to go,’” she recalled to OK! Mercury insisted nothing was wrong.</p><p>After that, Austin recalls the relationship deteriorating at a time when the band was achieving incredible success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biogossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MTU5NTE2MTg2MjI3MjU0ODcy.jpg><h2><span id=The_Career_of_Mary_Austin>The Career of Mary Austin</span></h2><ul><li>For a couple of years, the couple shared a flat in West Kensington.
