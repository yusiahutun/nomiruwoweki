It’ll be the first time <a href=#>royal</a> fans will be able to spend their time visiting the grounds and explore the most private parts of the residence. The Firm has privately owned Balmoral Castle since 1852, and now <a href=#>King Charles</a> has decided to open it to tourists. It became a part of the palace’s lush and wide-ranging real estate catalog after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert first leased it sight unseen in 1848.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-opens-the-doors-to-balmoral-castle>King Charles opens the doors to Balmoral Castle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-52114247-1024x689.jpg><p>The historic gothic-revival castle was the late <a href=#>Queen’s favorite place</a>, alongside Sandringham in Norfolk, where she would spend her Christmas and New Year.</p><p>It was also the residence where she spent her final days, leaving her son, then Prince Charles, <a href=#>a sealed envelope</a>, before passing away in September 2022.</p><p>Fans have only been able to get a glimpse behind the curtains from pictures released to the public by the royals, but now they can see it for themselves.</p><p>Although <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> fans may have had the opportunity to imagine what it was like inside from reading his memoir Spare, they won’t need to anymore.</p><p>Tickets for internal tours will be on sale from July 1 until August 4 at $126. Fans will be guided around the historic castle by an expert who can tell you about the history of the estate.</p><p>Only 40 visitors will be permitted per day, so you may need to act fast when it opens.</p><p>But if you fancy a spot of afternoon tea in your ‘live like a royal for a day’ this is also available as well as a package, for $190.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-you-ll-have-to-act-fast>You’ll have to act fast</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=nofollow>website</a> reads: “For the first time since the Castle was completed in 1855, guests can take part in a private tour with our experienced guides; taking visitors on a historical journey through several of the beautiful rooms within Balmoral Castle.</p><p>“Visitors will learn about the origins of the Castle and how it has been loved by generations of the Royal Family; from the purchase of the Balmoral Estate by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, through to the present day, where rooms within the Castle are used today by Their Majesties The King and Queen and members of the royal family.”</p><p>Some of Charles’ watercolor paintings will also be on display, as well as outfits worn by the monarch and <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a>, the Queen Mother and Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>The gardens will be open to the public still and other events are planned for the summer, such as Family Cinema Day, Theater Day and a Great British Dog Walk.</p><p>Balmoral, not owned part of the Crown Estate, has been passed down to each monarch, so is in the hands of King Charles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-inside-balmoral-from-the-royals-themselves>Inside Balmoral – from the royals themselves</h2><p>Members of The Firm have described the estate many times over the years.</p><p>Prince Harry described it in Spare as “simply paradise. A cross between Disney World and some sacred druid grove.”</p><p>He explained “the wide portico and three gray-black speckled granite steps leading up to the massive front door of whiskey-colored oak” and described the “hooks for fishing rods and walking sticks and rubber waders and heavy waterproofs – so many waterproofs”.</p><p>It also has a private lift, which the late Queen would use, as well as a statue of Queen Victoria.</p><p>Princess Eugenie, his cousin, said it was “the most beautiful place on earth” where Queen Elizabeth was ‘most happy’.</p><p>The King also owns Birkhall, which has been passed down to monarchs since Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The 5000-acre estate was also bought by Albert for his son when he and Victoria snapped up the Scottish castle.</p><p>Charles would spend time staying at Birkhall when he was Prince of Wales.</p><p>Balmoral would be somewhere they could spend time as a family, something King Charles and other members enjoyed growing up. A Former housekeeper told Countryfile they would cook on the barbecue outside with no staff in sight.</p><p>It’s also believed to be the location where Prince Philip proposed to the then Princess Elizabeth.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2WBcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0mamqZ2eqHqjrcumpquZnGKzsL6Mn6Crq6Riwaq5xGaYrGWWlru0ecCbo55lpKR6t7XSoqtmr5iav6Z50K6cnqZdqL2mutNmnaKmkaF6pa3YrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fking-charles-opens-balmoral-for-first-time-as-fans-able-to-visit-where-queen-spent-final-days.html&text=King%20Charles%20opens%20Balmoral%20for%20first%20time%20as%20fans%20able%20to%20visit%20where%20Queen%20spent%20final%20days&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fking-charles-opens-balmoral-for-first-time-as-fans-able-to-visit-where-queen-spent-final-days.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fking-charles-opens-balmoral-for-first-time-as-fans-able-to-visit-where-queen-spent-final-days.html&title=King%20Charles%20opens%20Balmoral%20for%20first%20time%20as%20fans%20able%20to%20visit%20where%20Queen%20spent%20final%20days" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fking-charles-opens-balmoral-for-first-time-as-fans-able-to-visit-where-queen-spent-final-days.html&title=King%20Charles%20opens%20Balmoral%20for%20first%20time%20as%20fans%20able%20to%20visit%20where%20Queen%20spent%20final%20days" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fking-charles-opens-balmoral-for-first-time-as-fans-able-to-visit-where-queen-spent-final-days.html&title=King%20Charles%20opens%20Balmoral%20for%20first%20time%20as%20fans%20able%20to%20visit%20where%20Queen%20spent%20final%20days" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fking-charles-opens-balmoral-for-first-time-as-fans-able-to-visit-where-queen-spent-final-days.html&description=King%20Charles%20opens%20Balmoral%20for%20first%20time%20as%20fans%20able%20to%20visit%20where%20Queen%20spent%20final%20days" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./malavan-fc-23-football-club-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Malavan FC: 23 Football Club Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dad-justice-daughter-murder-london-playboy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I've lost faith after suspect in my daughter's death was released, says dad of student 'murdered by ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
