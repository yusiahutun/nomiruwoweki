Drink coffee</strong></h2><p id=ecCfmmanqMDr data-wc=47>&nbsp;A study by the School of Medicine at the University of Nottingham discovered that coffee stimulates 'brown fat' in our bodies, burning sugar and fat to produce body heat. So sipping on your morning Americano is actually good for you and will help keep that tum trim.</p><h2><strong>2. Moderate some vegetables - really!</strong></h2><p id=ennU9pXfHtUf data-wc=57>Legumes, beans and cruciferous vegetables (the likes of cabbage, cauliflower and brussel sprouts) are all highly nutritious and should certainly feature in your diet however, if you're not used to them, they can unfortunately cause you to become gassy. The best way to introduce them? Slowly. Give your body time to adjust to these types of carbohydrates.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3. Try a juice cleanse</strong></h2><p id=elmyv8DEBNxb data-wc=63>If you're looking to feel great on the inside, try a juice cleanse. They help to debloat, reset your body and recharge your energy levels. If a juice cleanse isn't for you, try a juice and soup cleanse combined - packed with nutrient-dense superfoods, the Press London version includes 4 juices and 2 soups per day, to keep you feeling full and fantastic.</p><h2><strong>4. Take debloating supplements&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eBnzfji8wkhS data-wc=48>The reviews speak for themselves on this one. The JS Health Detox + Debloat vitamin supports&nbsp;abdominal bloating and&nbsp;your liver’s detoxification processes. Containing nutrients to support the body’s natural cleansing processes and support digestive discomfort, this vitamin is your ticket to a soothed tummy and&nbsp;healthy&nbsp;liver.</p><p id=e-iXsvwJjstZ data-wc=56>For detoxing, you'll find&nbsp;Milk Thistle which is used in western herbal tradition to maintain and support natural liver cleansing and detoxification processes. Turmeric is proven to maintain and support liver&nbsp;health, and acts as a hepatoprotectant to protect the liver. Turmeric is also a strong antioxidant, which can support free radical damage in the body.</p><p id=e8wGtsTKB1WG data-wc=28>For the all-important debloat, you get fennel which is used in western herbal tradition to support normal digestion. Milk Thistle and Turmeric help promote bile secretion and flow.</p><p id=eYqqBkGB6qAT data-wc=8><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria Beckham's 20-minute trick to beat bloating</a></strong></p><h2><strong>5. Get enough sleep</strong></h2><p id=evmZuoofls3C data-wc=48>It's true - lack of sleep does contribute to weight gain, so make sure you get your full eight hours a night. When our bodies don't get enough <a class=hm-link href=#>sleep</a>, cortisol (the stress hormone) levels increase, which tells your body to save energy and get you through the day.</p><p id=eKMD96fCcpjY data-wc=36>Conserving energy means hanging onto body fat rather than burning it off, and that means a heavy stomach. Maybe your mattress is the problem - check out our <a class=hm-link href=#>edit of the best mattresses with top reviews</a>.</p><p id=e0stGWyNPsl6 data-wc=8><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>8 surprising sleep hacks from the royals</a></strong></p><h2><strong>6. Hit maximum chill&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eT9tON9tF3p9 data-wc=36>First things first, chill out. When you're feeling frazzled, your body produces more of the stress hormone which has a negative effect on your digestive system – leaving you feeling and looking bloated plus, possibly, constipated.</p><p id=e7jthZ_qELg7 data-wc=34>Try and relax whenever you can; even if it's for a few minutes a day, try listening to a meditation podcast, doing a few yoga poses or zoning out in front of the TV.</p><h2><strong>7. Take a bath&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=elxZpnOzFlAj data-wc=23>Get that chill time in with a bath – not just your normal bath bomb scented affair but one with Epsom Salts instead.</p><p id=eV6PPzRI20fP data-wc=39>Dump in a tub load (or two cups full to be precise) and it can help reduce bloating by drawing excess water from your tum. It's a great trick for those days you want your tummy to look flatter.</p><h2><strong>8. Dine on dark chocolate&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=ekNTJcqGfOue data-wc=17>Plus, it gives you an energy boost so you might not skip that home workout after all...</p><h2><strong>9. Work on your posture&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=ed6qBKJ-eJhb data-wc=37>Hunching over our desks, phones, tablets and the likes can throw your posture totally out of whack. A good posture not only makes you look slimmer, as you stand taller, but it engages your stomach muscles too.</p><p id=eNHIw4h_VXcu data-wc=48>Try to sit with your back straight and shoulders back, and place both feet on the floor. If that doesn't work, set yourself a reminder on your phone or computer to sit up straight every 20 or so minutes. You can also buy posture correctors&nbsp;to help, too.</p><h2><strong>10. Suck on some lemon (water)&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=e19OTmmv9N4F data-wc=31>An easy morning routine to get yourself into is to sip on warm water and lemon first thing; it can help to reduce inflammation in the gut and de-bloat your stomach.</p><h2><strong>11. Bin the gum&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eTkARdlJ-rGM data-wc=65>When you chew gum, you swallow extra air which leads to, you guessed it, bloating. It tricks your body into thinking it's about to be fed and it starts to prep itself for food – when there's no food for it to process, there's an excess of stomach acid which again, causes bloating. So it might be time to ditch that seemingly innocent, minty habit.</p><p id=egxQgB0xgBoH data-wc=13><strong>SHOP: <a class=hm-link href=#>These are the best women's trainers for everything from sports to style</a></strong></p><h2><strong>12. Ditch the salt</strong></h2><p id=eVjkVJOOPkP6 data-wc=70>Cut down on your salt intake to help beat bloating tummies. According to experts, reducing salt to just 3g a day by avoiding all processed foods, will help your body release water it has been retaining to help dilute high salt levels in your body.&nbsp;If you do need to use salt, try to make it natural sea salt; teaspoon to teaspoon, it is lower in sodium than table salt.</p><p id=eI8GX-ILv7zZ data-wc=41>And stay away from soy sauce which has high levels of sodium and will cause almost instant bloating. You can always flavour your food with other herbs and spices; cayenne pepper, cumin and tabasco sauce will also help boost your metabolism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fb4b1b055494-dinner-z.jpg><h2><strong>13. Avoid food on the go</strong></h2><p id=ecCwICRhAlPF data-wc=56>Make sure you slow down and sit down at all mealtimes. It will help you relax and focus on what you are eating. And make sure you mind your manners. Eating with your mouth closed, and not talking while you are chewing, will reduce the amount of air that would otherwise get trapped in your stomach.</p><p id=eavWvcvmDmNA data-wc=31>You should also try to chew more – calories can be reduced by as much as 12 per cent by chewing each mouthful 40 times rather than 15, research has shown.</p><h2><strong>14. Go green</strong></h2><p id=elhs9chK_vx2 data-wc=57>Research has shown a direct link between green tea and smaller waists. Green tea contains compounds called catechins, which increase the release of fat from fat cells, help boost energy expenditure and speed up the burning of fat by the liver. Study participants drank four or five cups a day, but any amount will benefit your body.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>15. Eat slower</strong></h2><p id=eI4kMkria1_O data-wc=54>This takes practice but eating slower can really help you to beat the bloat. If you're eating too quickly, you're likely to be swallowing larger pieces of food which slow&nbsp;down the digestion process and likely leaves you bloated. Meals should last about 25 to 30 minutes so use this as a ballpark pointer.</p><p id=e-eFie1vIcIx data-wc=33>And remember, some people argue that taking longer to eat your food will mean you eat less overall as your body and brain are given the time to register that you're actually full.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-EcgwHAmbPW data-wc=11><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>The supplements to take daily, from Vitamin D to iron</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>16. Drink plenty of water</strong></h2><p id=eyuz_1ySalP8 data-wc=60>Hydration is key to weight loss. Did you know that the brain struggles to recognise the difference between being hungry and thirsty? As it turns out, thirst is often mistaken for a sugar craving so rather than heading to the cupboard and grabbing that secret chocolate bar you've got hidden at the back, try drinking a glass of water instead.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>17. Drink a glass of water before eating a meal</strong></h2><p id=eIHxuTpoDUOMh data-wc=47>Research has also found that drinking a glass of water before a meal can help to suppress appetite, meaning that you're more likely to indulge in a smaller and healthier sized portion while feeling fuller. One way to remind yourself? With a <span><a aria-label="Leopard water bottle" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">super chic reusable water bottle</a></span><span><a aria-label="Leopard water bottle" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">.</a></span></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>18. Dab a spot of vanilla on your wrists to limit sugar</strong></h2><p id=eMUNDJEin6qEC data-wc=44>In a study done by St George's Hospital, volunteers who wore a vanilla-scented patch on the inside of their wrists reported reduced cravings for chocolate and other sweet foods compared to a control group. You can replicate the study with a little vanilla extract.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>19. Consume gut-friendly foods</strong></h2><p id=eOJG13qAnwXMg data-wc=30>A happy gut means you're less likely to bloat or suffer with tummy aches. You can find live cultures and probiotics in gut-friendly food such as yoghurt and kombucha. Mmm.</p><h2 dir=ltr>20. Eat more fibre</h2><p id=ehRERW4R4NKHL data-wc=19>Fibre is proven to help the<span>&nbsp;digestive system function effectively. In turn, a healthy digestive system can reduce bloating.</span></p><p id=eU_ljsrzLU875 data-wc=6><strong>NOW CLICK THESE FOR MORE TIPS</strong></p><p id=eeAmEz-7J31wr data-wc=11><a class=hm-link href=#>15 ways to get rid of water retention for light-as-air legs</a></p><p id=eUyWmxAwy0BhJ data-wc=11><a class=hm-link href=#>Fun activewear that will actually make you want to work out</a></p><p id=eKpqgXSqpi9sZ data-wc=8><a class=hm-link href=#>8 best juice cleanses to try in 2022</a></p><p id=eM5bPt7cemL7G data-wc=42>HELLO!'s selection is editorial and independently chosen – we only feature items our editors love and approve of.
