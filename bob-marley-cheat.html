The legendary reggae musician was married to Rita, but was known to have many children from extra-marital affairs.</p><p>Bob Marley was born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, on February 6, 1945, and became friends with Bunny Wailer with whom he would eventually form Bob Marley and the Wailers. He converted to Rastafari, where his songs “Redemption Song,” “Jah Live,” and “So Jah S’eh” were influenced by his own beliefs. Other popular songs of him include “Buffalo Soldier,” “No Woman, No Cry,” and “Three Little Birds.”</p><p>Bob met the young Alfarita “Rita” Constantia Anderson in the mid-1960s and eventually married in 1966. The two have had a tumultuous, but loving, relationship as they continued&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their music careers</a>. Both Bob and Rita had affairs and had children with each other people, but they continued to love each other until <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/music/1696076/how-bob-marley-die/ rel="noreferrer noopener">his death</a>.</p><p>Bob’s life is now the subject of a new biopic titled&nbsp;Bob Marley: One Love.&nbsp;The movie stars Kingsley Ben-Adir as the musician while Bob Marley’s son Ziggy produced the film. While debuting the film details at CinemaCon in 2023, Ziggy revealed that the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movie will be able</a>&nbsp;to deepen their connection with the late icon and learn more about the adversity he faced in spreading his layered messages of rebellion, love and unity. Ziggy also gave “huge thanks” to the people of Jamaica “who were critical in ensuring the authenticity of this production.”</p><p>So who did Bob Marley cheat with and who are his children’s mothers?

Bob was not a household name then in England, but that changed after I won Miss World and the press got wind of our relationship.”</p><p>“At the time, there were flats in the compound and me and my older brother resided in one of them,” she continued. “The Wailers rehearsed at the back of the building and Bob started to spend more time there. In the comings and goings, we started chatting here and there, the conversations became longer, sparks started to fly and we became romantically involved. It was a bit scary because ‘uptown’ girls of light complexion didn’t have relationships with Rastas. I knew I was crossing that invisible line in the sand. I don’t think I need to explain to anyone what the magnetism was all about. Bob was a man on a mission who knew what he was about. He was very purpose-driven, inspirational and influential all rolled into one. I knew that if I became involved with Bob, it would change my life forever.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.623215984776><h2>Rita Marley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rita-marley-kids.jpg><p>Bob met the young Alfarita “Rita” Constantia Anderson in the mid-1960s and eventually married in 1966.
