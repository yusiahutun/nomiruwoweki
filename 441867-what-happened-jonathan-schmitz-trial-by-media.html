The then-25-years-old had just killed a 32-year-old Scott Amedure. The crime occurred after Amedure admitted to having a secret crush on his killer during <i>The Jenny Jones Show</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Jonathan was born on July 18th, 1970, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. He was born to Allyn and Connie Schmitz. Until he murdered Scott Amedure, not much about him was in the limelight. As a result, his early life and <a href=#>profession</a> are not known.</p><h2>What happened to Jonathan Schmitz?</h2><p class=align-left><i>Trial By Media</i> is a <a href=#>Netflix</a> series examining the impact press coverage had on a number of high-profile cases. It explores how Jonathan was, perhaps, lured to appear on <i>The Jenny Jones Show</i> under murky pretences. It also looks at how the same-sex crush would have affected his life in the '90s. So, what happened?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Alex Kompo: Former Siesta Key star's life and latest updates</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/22b857cbf8b5202b.jpg><p class=align-left>Amedure and Schmitz appeared on <i>The Jenny Jones Show</i> on March 6th, 1995, for an episode called <i>Same Sex Secret Crushes</i>. During the show, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amedure confessed</a> his love for Schmitz. This got Jonathan by surprise because he had thought he was on the show to get back with his ex-girlfriend.</p><p class=align-left>Three days later, Jonathan confronted him at his home and shot him. Schmitz shot him twice and killed him instantly before giving himself over to the police and confessing to the crime. He was then arrested and charged with murder.</p><h2>Jonathan Schmitz’s murder case</h2><p class=align-left>Jonathan first went on trial in 1996. He was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison. He appealed but was found guilty of the crime again in 1999, and his sentence remained the same.</p><p class=align-left>During the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">murder case</a>, Schmitz’s defence claimed that he had a thyroid disorder and manic depression. The defence argued that he was caused to commit homicide by mental illness and humiliation. Furthermore, his father also said that Jonathan had tried to kill himself before.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/983b40415f243d8a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jeremy Rytky: What you should know about Andrea Barber's ex-husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One of Scott Amedure's friends testified that Schmitz and Amedure had a sexual encounter following the show. Three days after the show was taped, Scott allegedly left a note to Schmitz that was suggestive in nature. The message infuriated Jonathan, who went to the bank, took money out and purchased a shotgun. He used the gun to murder Scott.</p><p class=align-left>Did the Amedure <a href=#>family</a> get any money? In 1999, the family sued <i>The Jenny Jones Show </i>for negligence and the use of ambush tactics. They claimed that the negligent actions resulted in their son’s death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg><p class=align-left>The jury awarded the family $29 million.

He revealed that he was troubled by the parole decision.</p>I wanted assurance that the decision was not based on just good behaviour in prison. I’d like to know that he learned something, that he’s a changed man, is no longer homophobic and has gotten psychological care.<p class=align-left>Schmitz, on his part, keeps a low profile after his release. There are strict rules that prevent him even from shifting residence for an allocated time. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">continues to live</a> with his parents in their family home in Lapeer, Michigan.</p><p class=align-left>Since he was released from prison, he has stayed away from the limelight.
