Of course, Friends remains a potent cultural landmark, which still has the power to galvanize audiences, as evidenced by the show’s popularity within the streaming realm and the stunned widespread reaction to the untimely death of cast member <a href=#>Matthew Perry</a>, who was only twenty-five when the pilot episode of Friends debuted on NBC on September 22, 1994.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The appeal of Friends was initially grounded in the fact that audiences felt that they knew these characters. The intense familiarity that audiences developed with the show’s characters compelled viewers to scrutinize and speculate upon seemingly every aspect of the characters’ lives, including their ages and birthdays, which seemed to continually shift over the course of the series. Indeed, while the show’s characters made various references to their ages and birthdays throughout the series, contradictions abound throughout the series, to the point where even the characters seem confused as to how old they are.</p><h2 id=rachel-green-is-the-youngest-friends-character>Rachel Green is the Youngest Friends Character</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/tv/lUBPvx7Xx1X2ts0Cr6nMTG1tV9HFDS.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Friends</a></h5><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>September 22, 1994</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>10</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of the six main characters in <a href=#>Friends</a>, Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, was referenced several times over the course of the series as being the youngest member of the group. Rachel, whose birthday was variously mentioned as being May 5 throughout the series, was <strong>supposedly 24</strong> in the pilot episode. In the Season 7 episode “The One Where They All Turn Thirty” from 2001, Rachel turned 30.</p><p>As Rachel’s age seems to be inextricably tied to that of Monica Geller, who was Rachel’s best friend from high school, from where they presumably graduated in the same year, Monica, played by <a href=#>Courteney Cox</a>, ages the most inconsistently throughout the series, particularly in the show’s first season, in which Monica is <strong>variously revealed to be 24, 25, and 26 years old</strong>.</p><p>Monica’s older brother, Ross Geller, <strong>is clearly 26</strong> in the pilot episode, in which Ross, played by David Schwimmer, describes himself as being 26 and a recent divorcee. In Season 3, Ross refers to himself as being 29, and in the Season 9 episode “The One Where Emma Cries” from 2002, Ross states that his birthday is October 18.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that Chandler Bing, played by Matthew Perry, was Ross’s best friend from college, it’s reasonable to assume that Chandler, whose age and birthday are mentioned the least of all the characters on the show, is <strong>also 26</strong> in the pilot episode. Chandler’s other best friend, Joey, played by Matt LeBlanc, was revealed to be <strong>25 in the Season 1</strong> episode “The One with the Birth” from 1995. However, Joey states that he’s <strong>28 in the Season 2</strong> episode “The One Where Joey Moves Out” from 1996.</p><h2 id=the-friends-cast-and-characters-had-similar-ages>The Friends Cast and Characters Had Similar Ages</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Lisa Kudrow, who was 31 when the pilot episode of <a href=#>Friends</a> debuted, is the oldest member of the show’s cast, by approximately one year over Courteney Cox, Kudrow’s character, Phoebe Buffay, who is believed to be <strong>27 or 28 in the pilot</strong>, is also the show’s oldest character.</p><p>However, beyond Cox and Kudrow, the ages of the rest of the cast members are fairly close to those of their characters. Matthew Perry, who was the youngest cast member at 25 when the pilot debuted, was only approximately one year younger than his character, Chandler Bing, while the next youngest cast member, Jennifer Aniston, who was also 25 when the pilot debuted, was almost exactly the same age as her character. Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer were both 27, just slightly older than their characters, when the pilot debuted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=the-main-characters-39-ages-in-season-1>The Main Characters' Ages in Season 1</h3><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Character</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Age in Season One</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rachel</p></td><td><p>24</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Monica</p></td><td><p>24/25/26</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ross</p></td><td><p>26</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chandler</p></td><td><p>26</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Joey</p></td><td><p>25</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Phoebe</p></td><td><p>27/28</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/10-sitcoms-that-were-clearly-inspired-by-friends.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>10 Sitcoms That Were Clearly Inspired by Friends</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>It's been 30 years since Friends first premiered, and in that time, plenty of sitcoms have pulled inspiration from the timeless '90s series.</span><h2 id=do-the-inconsistencies-matter>Do the Inconsistencies Matter?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides the various continuity errors that exist within <a href=#>Friends</a> regarding the ages and birthdays of the show’s main characters, some of the confusion also stems from the fact that many viewers have assumed that each season of the show, for which seven of the show’s ten seasons encompass 24 episodes, corresponds exactly to one year in the lives of the characters. Regardless of whether each season of Friends spans one year or 24 weeks in the lives of the show’s main characters, it’s obvious that Friends never intended to create any type of consistent canon regarding the characters’ ages and birthdays.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/friends-poster-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Friends: The Most Iconic Quotes from the Main Characters, Ranked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Friends may be one of the most quotable shows ever.

Friends became, and remains, a beloved sitcom because the show was most consistent with the show’s core titular premise of six quirky people who become intertwined in one another’s lives while navigating the challenges of adulthood in New York City over the course of a decade. Indeed, as it’s virtually impossible to accurately pinpoint the characters’ ages and birthdays, it’s easier to think of Friends simply as a show about six 20-somethings who become 30-somethings.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stream on Max</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6u2psPEm2Wcp51ks7O1xKebrGWYpMRuu8udZJqqlWLBqbGMppiipl2YtaK%2BwJyrnqqjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffriends-how-old-are-the-main-characters.html&text=How%20Old%20Are%20the%20Main%20Characters%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffriends-how-old-are-the-main-characters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-how-old-are-the-main-characters.html&title=How%20Old%20Are%20the%20Main%20Characters%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffriends-how-old-are-the-main-characters.html&title=How%20Old%20Are%20the%20Main%20Characters%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-how-old-are-the-main-characters.html&title=How%20Old%20Are%20the%20Main%20Characters%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffriends-how-old-are-the-main-characters.html&description=How%20Old%20Are%20the%20Main%20Characters%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-middleton-royal-blue-dress-catherine-walker-commonwealth-day-service.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Middleton makes jaws drop in royal blue dress - and a Jackie O style hat">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./us-navy-reveals-superslippery-paint-submarines-warships-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="US Navy reveals 'superslippery' paint for submarines and warships">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
