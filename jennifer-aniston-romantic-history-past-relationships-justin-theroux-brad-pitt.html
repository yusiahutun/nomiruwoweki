But <a class=hm-link href=#>despite their divorce</a>, which was finalized in October 2005, Jennifer and Brad have remained friends.</p><h2>Justin Theroux</h2><p id=elNt26mSH_x_ data-wc=63>Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux went from co-stars to husband and wife and built a wonderful life together in Bel Air. The pair <strong>met through Ben Stiller in 2007,</strong> as Justin co-wrote the film Tropic Thunder with Ben, and Jennifer and Ben are long-time friends. But then in 2011, they also starred in the film Wanderlust together, <strong>which is where the romance blossomed.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/d16077c96b00-jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux.jpg><p id=e26u0AYP1k2H data-wc=42><strong>The couple got engaged in August 2012,</strong> when<span><strong>&nbsp;Justin popped the question on her 41st birthday</strong></span> while they were in New York.

It was <strong>February 2018 when the couple called it quits</strong> and announced their divorce to the world.&nbsp;</p><p id=eOPX8JBsjNgy data-wc=96>In a joint statement shared by the former couple, they insisted the split was amicable. It read: "We have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. <strong>We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship."&nbsp;</strong>The pair were <a class=hm-link href=#>spotted enjoying a dinner together</a> in a New York City restaurant in April, &nbsp;however, they have been open in the past about how they want to keep their post-divorce relationship <a class=hm-link href=#>out of the spotlight</a>.</p><h2>Tate Donovan</h2><p id=et_hqWmIDugo data-wc=36>The star's longest relationship with a Friends co-star was with T<strong>ate Donovan, known as the handsome Joshua on the show,</strong> but the pair were actually breaking up by the time he joined the sitcom in 1999.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8f1554911c25-jennifer-anniston-tate-donovan-z.jpg><p id=eLZPO9h8pvZT data-wc=49>Tate, whose <strong>ex-girlfriend is Sandra Bullock,</strong> enjoyed a three-year relationship with Jennifer after they were set up by mutual friends. By their first anniversary, the couple had exchanged Irish commitment rings and in a romantic gesture for his beloved, he surprised her with a puppy, Enzo, for Valentine's Day.</p><p id=eLFtbB2GYvww data-wc=108>The pair split after three years together, ahead of Tate's time on the show which only lasted for six episodes, in part due to the fact the former couple struggled to handle their break-up whilst filming together. Talking about their split <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Tate told Us Weekly</a>: "<strong>I was just happy to be on the team. The only bummer was Jennifer and I were breaking up at the time</strong> and so that was tricky to sort of act, and act like we are just meeting each other, and falling in love, or whatever, interested in each other, when we're sort of breaking up. That was just tough."</p><h2>David Schwimmer</h2><p id=eRaXFiS2e7t1 data-wc=32>Jennifer and David Schwimmer sent fans into a tailspin in 2021, <strong>when they revealed a long-held secret that the pair were both taken with each other whilst on the set of Friends.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf5cac6154ee-jennifer-anniston-david-schwimmer-z.jpg><p id=e71DC5zPfd3S data-wc=52>Sitting down with James Cordon and their castmates from the show during the Friends Reunion, David revealed: "<strong>At some point, we were crushing hard on each other, but it was like two ships passing, because one of us was always in a relationship and we never crossed that boundary. We respected that</strong>."</p><p id=efMPCzdJCb_X data-wc=70>Jennifer added, <strong>"Honestly, I remember saying one time to David, 'It's going to be such a bummer if the first time you and I actually kiss is going to be on national television.'</strong> Sure enough, first time we kissed was in that coffee shop." Rather than getting romantically involved in real life, Jennifer added that they "channeled all of our adoration and love for each other into Ross and Rachel."</p><h2>Paul Rudd</h2><p id=eXuw7VwISo-q data-wc=43>The Object of My Affection&nbsp;costars <strong>kept very quiet about their rumored relationship for years</strong>, but Jennifer did eventually confirm that the pair enjoyed a brief romance, reportedly joking that they were "together when we were, like, 12," - who would have thought!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bf9a53137be3-jennifer-aniston-paul-rudd.jpg><h2>Daniel McDonald</h2><p id=eaSqkbeN-7gk data-wc=79>Jennifer dated fellow actor Daniel McDonald from 1990 - 1995 and<strong>&nbsp;sweetly referred to him as her "first love"</strong> in a heartfelt interview with&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The New York Times</a><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;in 2015</a>. She said: "He was my first love—five years we were together. He would have been the one. But I was 25, and I was stupid. He must have sent me Justin [Theroux] to make up for it all." The pair split just before she landed her role on Friends.</p><h2>Charlie Schlatter</h2><p id=ezzW3rG9jVyx data-wc=36>Before her life-changing stint on Friends, Jennifer and Charlie starred in the Schlatter TV adaptation of the John Hughes film Ferris Bueller's Day Off and sparked romance rumors during their time on the show in 1990.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/26ed146fb36f-jennifer-anniston-charlie-schlatter-z.jpg><h2>Adam Duritz</h2><p id=emh79xDQCBs- data-wc=87>In 1995, Jennifer dated Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz after they met in <a class=hm-link href=#>Johnny Depp</a>'s Los Angeles nightclub, the Viper Room. In an episode of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Vice's Dark Side of the '90s</a>, Adam revealed:"I met Jennifer Aniston there, cause a bunch of my friends lied to me and told me she had a crush on me. Those same friends lied to her and told her I had a crush on her." He added: "It didn't last very long, but she's a nice girl."</p><h2>Vince Vaughn</h2><p id=eKa7kEvF24DW data-wc=50>After her very public divorce from Brad Pitt in 2005, Jennifer sparked a flame with her The Break-up co-star Vince Vaughn whilst filming the film together. The pair enjoyed a brief romance in 2006, and Jennifer revealed to&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Vogue</a><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;in 2008&nbsp;</a>that her fellow actor<strong>&nbsp;"brought her back to life".</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a2f0b393b923-jennifer-anniston-vince-vaughn-z.jpg><p id=e5ali4xNDajH data-wc=72>She explained:<strong>&nbsp;"I call Vince my defibrillator. He literally brought me back to life," she shared. "My first gasp of air was a big laugh! It was great. I love him</strong>. He's a bull in a china shop. He was lovely and fun and perfect for the time we had together. And I needed that. And it sort of ran its course." The pair split amicably after less than a year together.</p><h2>John Mayer</h2><p id=enTLTH2mFqRm data-wc=60>Whilst unaware of the star's dulcet tones at the time, Jennifer began dating musician John Mayer in February 2008 after meeting him at an Oscars party. And <strong>after bumping into him a week later, the pair began dating.</strong> The duo endured an on-again-off-again relationship, first splitting up in March 2009.
